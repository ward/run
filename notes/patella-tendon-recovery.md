## What

I had overloaded my patella tendon and it got inflamed. I went to the PT
reasonably quickly, but recovery was (is) still a drag. Recovery was focused on

1. Give the patella tendon rest by avoiding (too much) repetitive impact stuff
   like running and walking.
2. Do lots of strength work to train the leg muscles so they do not get tired
   as quickly and can take all the impact.

This document is, for now, a brain dump of the various exercises the PT made me
do. I had been meaning to write it all down in a structured manner, but then
someone asked about it so brain dump will do. Who knows if and how long it will
take to get around to bother with a proper presentation.

## I Just Want To Run More

After the first visit, he banned me from running for two weeks. Technically
just till our next appointment, but that's when I saw him next. Then I was
allowed to run 20 minutes every third day. I did that for nearly four weeks,
but that is because I had to be abroad for over a week and then he had vacation
and so it just took forever to get the next appointment. Maybe it would not
have taken that long otherwise. After that, I was allowed to up the time by 10
minutes every third run. During the last visit, about 2.5 months after the
first one, this was still in effect. He said during that last visit I could up
the frequency if there was no hint of the patella tendon any more in daily
stuff. "I rather have you run 1h30 every third day, then up the frequency just
yet". Of course, now I just ran 1h30 and I am not sure if I can keep pushing
beyond it. Hope I can self-assess that the more frequency is now allowed. I am
leaning towards yes, but I will give it another week probably. Possibly. (Of
course if you make that switch, cut the distance per run way down!)

Elliptical was allowed throughout. Walking as long as it was not too much
(absolute upper limit he gave was 15 km, but that is probably way too much
already). Biking was allowed after 3ish weeks. Basically everything with
repetitive impact was definitely avoid. Repetitive motion be careful with.
Swimming was definitely allowed. He also strongly encouraged stuff without
repetitiveness like padel, tennis, ... 

## Workouts

Listed roughly in the order that I was given them by the PT.

Nearly all of these can be made harder by having your foot/feet on top of a
Bosu ball, if you have access to it. Might have to build up to that. PT also
had some sort of squishy rubber pillow that was harder than being on regular
floor, but easier than being on the Bosu ball. Dunno what that was called.

Many of them involve some sort of balancing. Do not let your knee do weird
inward/outward rolls, remain in control.

If you notice you lose control too much, just call it a day rather than forcing
through.

The idea with all of these is to strengthen the leg muscles. Stronger leg
muscles means they'll get tired less easily. If the big leg muscles get too
tired, then all the smaller stuff has to pick up the slack and those aren't
made to handle it. I found almost all of these very thigh heavy, though he
assured me they also trained your calves. Guess my thighs are just the ones
that needed the work.

That first visit and first routine kicked my ass. Literally, the thigh muscles
were sore for two days. My body also got used to it very quickly though, I
started doing them daily and was fine. I later in the recovery commented on it,
saying how weak I was during that first visit. He pointed out that he wouldn't
have called me weak compared to many he sees in his cabinet. All that to say,
these exercises start where the PT thought they would be a good enough
challenge for me. Maybe others need to start with easier exercises. I cannot
help you there, but just doing _fewer_ of these reps should also see effects I
would think.

### First Routine

These he gave me the first time I saw him for patella tendon inflammation. I
was told to do them daily.

Everything was done 15 times each. Together is it one set. Do two sets total.

- Kneel (so lower legs are resting on the floor). Sit down into it (so butt
  goes towards heels of feet). Hold the stretch for 3 to 5 seconds. Come back
  up (lower legs remaining on the floor). I do this one daily as the first
  thing in the set, no matter what routine I do.
- Sit on chair, one foot firmly planted on floor, the other will not be used.
  Stand up using just the one leg. Sit back down (controlled, not just falling
  back). Be sure to not use the other leg's thigh to push down on the chair to
  help you get up. What I do is slightly lift the other thigh so it cannot help
  at all. Increase height of the chair (eg with pillows) to make this one
  easier. Decrease height to make it harder.
- Do it with other leg too.
- Stand on one leg. Squat (just go as deep as you think is feasible, no need to
  force it). Come back up.
- Do it with other leg too.
- Repeat previous, but have a small weight (he used 1.5 kg for me) lie in front
  of you. Pick it up when you squat down. Drop it off on the next one.
- Also repeat for the other leg.

### Second Routine

This was about two weeks later. He told me to start alternating. One day this
set, the other day the previous easier set. I did not like this set much.

Again do 2 sets, 15 reps for each exercise for each leg.

- Stand on one leg, jump forward, squat to pick up 1.5kg weight lying on the
  floor in front of you. Come back up. Squat again to place the weight down.
  (he made me jump onto his squishy rubber pillow, at home I just jumped onto
  my mat, easier balancing without the pillow or the bosu ball he would make me
  use later one).
- Stand on one leg. Squat for 5 seconds, jump up.
- Stand on one leg. Squat as deep as you can. He told me the goal was to have
  the knee of the other leg touch the ground, but I am not bendy enough for
  that. Did not like this one at all.
- Hold the 1.5kg weight in your hand. Do a lunge. While in lunge position, have
  your arms stretched out before you, arms are together holding the weight. In
  lunge with the arms stretched out holding the weight, rotate 90 degrees left,
  rotate 90 degrees right. Hips and below stay in place. I had hurt my big toe
  some months ago and it was still complaining (painful) as the trailing leg in
  the lunge position so I did not like this exercise at all either.

### Third Routine

This was a bit over a month later. He had given me different stuff to do during
sessions, but this one he explicitly said I could do some days with this
routine. This is where I realised the two leg ones are more fun since I don't
need to worry about balancing.

- The one legged getting out of the chair from the first routine. By this point
  he set his height adjustable chair really low _and_ made me use the Bosu
  ball. At home it was just using whatever chair I had of course.
- Regular squat (so two legs), when you are in the squat, jump twice (so you
  remain in squat position, you dont come out of it to jump), get back up. I
  presume deeper = harder, but I am not bendy enough for a deep squat. It was
  still intense enough regardless. (maybe non-deep even makes it harder since
  your muscles are working to keep you in the awkward position).
- Regular squat, jump forward, jump backwards, get up. Again, no getting up for
  the jump part, you remain in squat position.
- For this one I just jotted down "one leg prev", but now I am unsure whether
  that included both previous ones or just the last one. Definitely the last
  one. So ye, do the one legged squat, jump forward, jump backward, get up.
  This one I found a bit too risky at times, it is easy to lose your balance
  landing the jump and hurt your knee. I don't do it as often.

### Various Others That Come To Mind

These I did not take explicit notes of, but I have done at some point. All the
one leg stuff you need to repeat entirely for the other leg.

- Stand on one leg, squat and hold for 2 seconds, jump and turn 90 degrees
  while remaining one leg squatted, come up. Do this till you make 5 turns (so
  20 reps).
- Calf raises. He gave me this after I said I did not feel my calves in any of
  his exercises. I felt them then :) Use a staircase or something. Stand on the
  ball of your foot, with the rest of the foot hovering above emptiness. Push
  your heel up as high as you can, then go low. Repeat 15 times for each foot.
  You can hold onto something for balance.
- Standing on bosu ball on one foot, slightly bent knee. Bend forward at
  your hip to get close to superman position, bend backward at hip as far as
  feasible. This one was frustrating cause I just could not
  keep my balance when leaning back.
- One leg squat, jump forward onto bosu ball, landing with a straight leg.
