Some interesting links, categorised where possible. Non-exhaustive list, things
are simply added when I remember to do so.

## Managing Run Data

* [GoldenCheetah](http://www.goldencheetah.org/). Open source program, data is
  kept locally and in an open format. Possibly a bit difficult to get going
  with. Edition as of writing (August 2018) still shows signs of having started
  out as a cycling only application.
* [Strava](https://www.strava.com/dashboard). The "social" one. Not very good
  with the data, but all your friends are on here so you use it.

## Mapping a Route

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). A map data provider kept up
  to date by its users. I often find it provides better information on trails
  than Google Maps or similar providers. See there is a trail or something else
  missing? Fix it!
* [Openrouteservice](https://maps.openrouteservice.org/reach) provides the
  possibility of plotting "isochrones". The idea is plotting the distance from
  a point, but using actual roads to measure this distance, not just dumping a
  circle around the location. Might be interesting when deciding where to run
  to/from.
* [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) gathers trail routes you can discover
  yourself. I found it useful when in the USA, but lacking in Belgium.
* [plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/myhome) lets you click spots and
  create the actual route. Defaults to Google Maps data, but you can easily
  enable OpenStreetMap.

## Finding a Race

### Road

* [Go Running](http://gorunning.be/index_nl.php) is a website that the VAL
  links to, so I assume it is relatively complete in Belgian races. Have not
  tested it thoroughly myself.
* [Stratenlopen Kalender](http://stratenlopen.be/calendar.php). Enables adding
  your own races.
* [Piet van der Nat loopagenda](https://www.phein.nl/loopagenda/). A big excel
  sheet. Mostly races in The Netherlands, also covers many races in Flanders.
* [Association of International Marathons and Distance
  Races](http://aims-worldrunning.org/directory.html) (AIMS) includes a bunch
  of worldwide races. If you want to qualify for the Berlin marathon, you will
  need one from this list. I guess that implies they are all nicely certified.
  They also provide a [calendar](http://aims-worldrunning.org/calendar.html).
* An overview of the [IAAF certified road
  races](https://www.iaaf.org/competitions/iaaf-label-road-races/calendar/2019).
  There are gold, silver, and bronze label ones. At least part of that has to
  do with prize money and number of elite athletes that attend.
* [Runedia](https://runedia.mundodeportivo.com/). Spanish races. Supposedly has
  all Spanish races.

### Track

* [LBFA calendar](https://calendrier.lbfa.be/) is the calendar of the French
  side of athletics in Belgium. Has outdoor track, indoor track, and also cross
  country.
* The VAL (Dutch side) website is crappier and less clear to find things.
  Generally I look around [this wedstrijdaanbod
  page](http://www.atletiek.be/competitie/atleten#wedstrijdaanbod) I think.
