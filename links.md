Some interesting links, categorised where possible. Non-exhaustive list, things
are simply added when I remember to do so.

# Managing Run Data

* [GoldenCheetah](http://www.goldencheetah.org/). Open source program, data is
  kept locally and in an open format. Possibly a bit difficult to get going
  with. Edition as of writing (August 2018) still shows signs of having started
  out as a cycling only application.
* [Strava](https://www.strava.com/dashboard). The "social" one. Not very good
  with the data, but all your friends are on here so you use it.

# Mapping a Route

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). A map data provider kept up
  to date by its users. I often find it provides better information on trails
  than Google Maps or similar providers. See there is a trail or something else
  missing? Fix it!
* [Openrouteservice](https://maps.openrouteservice.org/reach) provides the
  possibility of plotting "isochrones". The idea is plotting the distance from
  a point, but using actual roads to measure this distance, not just dumping a
  circle around the location. Might be interesting when deciding where to run
  to/from.
* [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/) gathers trail routes you can discover
  yourself. I found it useful when in the USA, but lacking in Belgium.
* [plotaroute.com](https://www.plotaroute.com/myhome) lets you click spots and
  create the actual route. Defaults to Google Maps data, but you can easily
  enable OpenStreetMap.

# Finding a Race

Main focus here will be *Belgian* races.

* [Stratenlopen Kalender](http://stratenlopen.be/calendar.php). Enables adding
  your own races.
* [Piet van der Nat loopagenda](https://www.phein.nl/loopagenda/). A big excel
  sheet. Mostly races in The Netherlands, also covers many races in Flanders.
* [Runedia](https://runedia.mundodeportivo.com/). Spanish races. Supposedly has
  all Spanish races.
