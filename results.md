â€  Result derived through linear interpolation of a longer race's result. In
other words, take the pace of the longer race and apply it as is to the shorter
distance.

## Results

Here an overview of the results of different races that I have taken part in.
Age grade for distances that are not somewhat standard would require
extrapolation, making it potentially useless to interpret, if done incorrectly.
Until I read, hear, or think up the correct way to handle this, I will likely
just keep it as question marks.
