The following is not mine. It was written down by [George
Malley][georgemalley], nicknamed "Malmo". Hence the name.  It is his idea of
base building of a sorts over summer. I find myself looking it up again from
time to time and always end up on some crappy website with horrible formatting.
It is, as far as I can tell copy pasted all over the early running internet,
which is why I hope it is OK if I do so too.

Takeaways from the plan are:

- Aimed at people with enough time in their summer (e.g., students on summer
  break)
- Run more
- Double 4+ days a week
- Meet up with others twice a week at the track
    - Once for ~threshold (6.5 - 10 km total)
    - Once for longer intervals, either
        - 4-6x1200-2000, one lap jog
        - 16-24x150-300m with 300m full recovery
- Slower people can just take a break more often and hop back in, because track

### THE SUMMER OF MALMO

To paraphrase George Costanza: "It's going to be the 'Summer of malmo!'"

**Q**: What is this so-called "Summer of malmo"?

**A**: It's a foolproof, no-nonsense, 100 percent guaranteed program that will help
runners of all abilities to improve their fitness over the summer WITHOUT the
attendant physical or mental fatigue. "Summer of malmo" revolves around a
relaxed commitment from a group to meet just twice a week for an organized
workout. One tempo run and one longer interval session. JUST TWICE A WEEK IS
ALL I ASK. Emphasis on RELAXED and emphasis on COMMITMENT. Make this a social
event.

**Q**: Who is it for?

**A**: Everyone (almost). Anyone that isn't reaching their full potential, and you
know who you are. It's for runners that have been THINKING about doing doubles
and haven't yet started. It's for you runners that have been THINKING of
jacking up the mileage and haven't yet started. It's for college runners. High
school runners. Boys, girls, men and women. Anyone that wants to make the leap
for next year's cross country season. Different skill levels? No problem.
Fitness levels? Coming off an injury and are way behind? It's OK, I've thought
of it all. This foolproof SCHEDULE is all things to all runners!

**Q**: Who isn't it for?

**A**: Any runner who has immediate racing goals. This "program" is a springboard
for the cross country season. An easy way to prepare oneself for the real
training to be done in the fall.

**Q**: I thought that you don't believe in writing SCHEDULES?

**A**: I don't, these workouts are only examples, you can customize it any way that
you want - EXCEPT FOR THE INTENSITY LEVEL. That part must always be relaxed and
within yourself. Otherwise it is not a genuine Summer of malmoâ„¢ product and
your warranty will be null and void.

**Q**: How do I start?

**A**: First up, call all of your running friends, crew, homeys, goodbuddies,
gangmates, posse, stable, team or pals and commit to meet twice a week for a
workout. Get together with runners from other teams in your town or city. Make
it a social event. Meet for pizza or a BBQ afterwards. Start now. Also, start
running twice a day now. In the words of John Ngugi, "Don't waste good time."
Do doubles four, five or six days a week. Can't make it four days? Then do
three. For most of you grasshoppers doubles are the missing element that is
keeping you from reaching your full potential, so start 'em now.

**Q**: What if I get tired?

**A**: You will get tired, I can guarantee it. IT WILL PASS. Trust me.

**Q**: How many miles should I run?

**A**: I don't know, but more than you've been doing. The time is now to find out
exactly where your personal sweet spot is. The main goals are to (1) increase
the mileage and (2) to run doubles. Some of you may be running over 100 miles
per week for the first time, other still think that running 70 mpw is a lot.
It's OK, this PROGRAM will accommodate everyone.

**Q**: My friends are going to meet twice a week, where?

**A**: On the track. Why? Because the PROGRAM is designed to accommodate everyone
with one simple formula. You'll see soon enough.

**Q**: What workouts do we do?

**A**: Once a week meet for a tempo run on the track of four to six miles. The
other workout is four to six by 1200m to 2000m with one lap jog, OR 16 to 24 by
150m to 300m with FULL RECOVERY - that's a really slow jog. Walk if you have
to. You determine what you want to do; these are just recommendations.

**Q**: How fast?

**A**: Whatever is comfortable for the group. Not once should you come off of the
workout with your eyes rolling back in your heads, that's not the point.
Basically it's threshold training, but don't tell anyone I said so - I've got
an image to uphold.

Let's say on your tempo run you've got four of you who are comfortable with
5:20 pace for five miles but you have two others who would have to struggle
with that pace and another two who just simply are not in shape. No problem.
The middle two could probably run for two miles, rest a lap and when the group
comes around again, jump back in. Just as long as it's still a tempo run for
them. Both the leaders and the runners jumping back in will benefit from each
other. Those two out-of-shape runners? Jump in at the back of the pack for a
lap or two, rest a lap, jump back in for another lap or two, and repeat until
the run is over. Each week they'll be able to run more and more, and before you
know it, they'll be right up there with the lead group. Same thing with the
long interval session.

The beauty of the "Summer of malmo" is that no matter what kind of shape you or
your comrades-in-sweat are in you can all train together and benefit from each
other.

**Q**: What should my heart rate be?

**A**: I don't have a clue. I'm trying to get you to "feel" Kung Fu, not "think"
it.

**Q**: What about those 200s? Why are we doing speed work now?

**A**: The only way to run fast is to, well, run fast. The time to start is now.
Let's say the group is running 200s. Just go out and run them. FULL RECOVERY.
The whole point is to train the neuromuscular system, to concentrate on the
mechanics of running - you know it: forward lean, arm carriage, knees up and
out, heels clipping your butt, stride length and turnover. I've always been
amazed at the number of runners that think that they can "get speed" during the
last three weeks of the season. It doesn't work that way.

**Q**: So what you're saying is a five mile tempo run once a week AND, lets say,
five by one mile, OR 16 x 200 for the other workout?

**A**: That's exactly what I'm saying. All of these workouts should be within
yourself. Remember this isn't the end-all training program, it will prepare
your for the real work to begin in September.

**Q**: No hill repeats?

**A**: Nope. If you want to, go ahead, but the objective here is to get the most
during the summer with the least amount of effort - that's PHYSICAL and MENTAL.
By meeting twice a week and running in a group the mental effort should be at a
minimum. REMEMBER, NO RACING IN THE FUCKIN' WORKOUT!!! There will be plenty of
time for that later.

**Q**: What about the other days?

**A**: Keep those doubles going. If you're out on a run and are feeling good you
just might rip into another tempo run. My favorite: "run to the barn", that is,
the last two to three miles of an easy run just let it rip. Go into orbit. Some
of you geeks might even call it AT training.

**Q**: I live in the country and don't have anyone else to run with.

**A**: That's OK. Just do your tempo runs on the roads. For your long repeats you
might just go out on the roads for an hour or so of 5:00 easy/5:00 hard (on of
my favorite workouts). Still the same principles apply to you. All of these
workouts should be run within yourself.

**Q**: I want to run some summer road races, can I?

**A**: Sure, why not? As long as these races are not the end-all. You've got bigger
fish to fry in the fall so take it easy. Who are you trying to impress in the
summer anyway? Not me, baby. Save it for later. If you've got the discipline
then run your tempo run during these races. Alright, I know that everyone has
one race that they'd like to concentrate on, go ahead and go for it. Just don't
make it a weekly habit.

**Q**: How much will this cost?

**A**: Nothing. There is no "Gold, Silver, or Bronze" plan to sign up for. I won't
provide increasing levels of attention dependent upon the amount on the check.
This program isn't about me, it's about you. I'm just passing on to you what is
public domain, hopefully you'll use it.

**Q**: Go over that again?

**A**: (1) twice-a-day, as many days as you can - four, five or six days a week (2)
increase your mileage, look, you guys are made of the same muscle and bone as
me, you can do it. Find your own sweet spot (3) meet with a group twice a week
(4) one tempo run of just four to six miles and (5) one workout of 1200m to
2000m repeats OR 16 to 24 by 150m to 300m (5) don't try to impress anyone, run
within yourself (6) relax, the real training doesn't begin until September.
