# Chapter 4: Training Runs and Intensities

This chapter describes the different types of runs he considers and their
point. "What is the point of this workout?" is something he likes to repeat.

* **E**asy. 59-74% of VO2max. 65-78% of maximum heart rate. Go slower or faster
  depending on how you feel. Build up injury resistance. Building base.
  Developing heart muscle. Increase in vascularisation. Develop the leg
  muscles. At least 30 minutes. At most 150 minutes. E is good to fill up your
  distance for the week.
* **L**ong. Also at E pace. If running <64km: max 30% of distance. If running
  more, maximum the min(25%, 150 minutes). Increasing E run duration is a
  confidence boost.
* **M**arathon-pace. 75-84% of VO2max. (No heart rate estimate?) Use his tables
  to know the pace. "3 min/10k slower than 10k race pace". Keep it shorter than
  min(110 minutes, 29km). For a single session, shorter than min(20% week
  distance, 29km).  Mostly there for confidence and practising water drinking.
  Obvious for marathon trainers, but also still useful for the rest with same
  idea.  Physiologically same effect as E.
* **T**hreshold. 86-88% of VO2max. 88-90% of maximum heart rate. Peaked and
  rested you can race this for 1 hour. Manageable to run, comfortably hard, but
  you look forward to the end. Get better at managing and clearing blood
  lactate. Improve speed you can keep up for a long time. Two types, both at T
  pace:
    * Tempo runs: One steady block at the pace. Good for confidence. He usually
      limits these to 20 minutes.
    * Cruise intervals: Short rests between blocks of T pace. Can get more T
      running into the body. (Feels too easy? Shorten the rest). He uses 1 or 2
      mile intervals (1.6k and 3.2k) with 1 and 2 minutes of rest respectively.
      Work to recovery ratio is about 5 to 1.

  Single workout no more than 10% of weekly distance. If you can do steady 20
  min, then do at least 30 min if doing cruise intervals.  Only count the T
  parts here of course, not the E that is warmup, cooldown, ...
* **I**nterval. Purpose: maximize aerobic power (VO2max). To improve it, need
  intensity close to or at that.  Takes 90-120s to work up to VO2max. Maximum
  you can run at it is 11 minutes.  Training between 3-5 minutes, but if you
  keep recovery short, you can make each interval shorter still. Longer than 5
  is too demanding. Shorter works since the short recovery time enables
  reaching VO2max more quickly in the next interval.  From resting, it takes ~2
  minutes to reach VO2max. Don't go beyond your VO2max pace: no extra benefit,
  just extra useless stress, and your next intervals might be too slow
  rendering them useless. His **I** workouts are based on distance in a certain
  time.  Maximum per week: min(10k, 8% * weekly distance).
* (**H**ard). Like **I**, but based on time. Pace is by feel of 10-12 min
  racing. For calculation, assume 5 min =~ 1600m. **H** is handy at altitude,
  hitting paces is difficult there.
* **R**epetition. Purpose: improve anaerobic power, speed, running economy.
  Form very important. Hard:recovery ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 (based on time). Other
  suggestion: 400m hard, 400m jog with possible walk the last 10-20 meter.
  Maximum per week: min(8k, 5% * weekly distance). Single interval should max
  out at ~2 minutes.
