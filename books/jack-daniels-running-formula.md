# Chapter 4: Training Runs and Intensities

This chapter describes the different types of runs he considers and their
point. "What is the point of this workout?" is something he likes to repeat.

* **E**asy. 59-74% of VO2max. 65-78% of maximum heart rate. Go slower or faster
  depending on how you feel. Build up injury resistance. Building base.
  Developing heart muscle. Increase in vascularisation. Develop the leg
  muscles. At least 30 minutes. At most 150 minutes. E is good to fill up your
  distance for the week.
* **L**ong. Also at E pace. If running <64km: max 30% of distance. If running
  more, maximum the min(25%, 150 minutes). Increasing E run duration is a
  confidence boost.
* **M**arathon-pace. 75-84% of VO2max. (No heart rate estimate?) Use his tables
  to know the pace. "3 min/10k slower than 10k race pace". Keep it shorter than
  min(110 minutes, 29km). For a single session, shorter than min(20% week
  distance, 29km).  Mostly there for confidence and practising water drinking.
  Obvious for marathon trainers, but also still useful for the rest with same
  idea.  Physiologically same effect as E.
* **T**hreshold. 86-88% of VO2max. 88-90% of maximum heart rate. Peaked and
  rested you can race this for 1 hour. Manageable to run, comfortably hard, but
  you look forward to the end. Get better at managing and clearing blood
  lactate. Improve speed you can keep up for a long time. Two types, both at T
  pace:
    * Tempo runs: One steady block at the pace. Good for confidence. He usually
      limits these to 20 minutes.
    * Cruise intervals: Short rests between blocks of T pace. Can get more T
      running into the body. (Feels too easy? Shorten the rest). He uses 1 or 2
      mile intervals (1.6k and 3.2k) with 1 and 2 minutes of rest respectively.
      Work to recovery ratio is about 5 to 1.

  Single workout no more than 10% of weekly distance. If you can do steady 20
  min, then do at least 30 min if doing cruise intervals.  Only count the T
  parts here of course, not the E that is warmup, cooldown, ...
* **I**nterval. Purpose: maximize aerobic power (VO2max). To improve it, need
  intensity close to or at that. Takes 90-120s to work up to VO2max. Maximum
  you can run at it is 11 minutes. Training between 3-5 minutes, rest half the
  time of the rep. If you keep recovery short, you can make each interval
  shorter still. Longer than 5 is too demanding. Shorter still works since the
  short recovery time enables reaching VO2max more quickly in the next
  interval. From resting, it takes ~2 minutes to reach VO2max. Don't go beyond
  your VO2max pace: no extra benefit, just extra useless stress, and your next
  intervals might be too slow rendering them useless. His **I** workouts are
  based on distance in a certain time.  Maximum for single session:
  min(10k, 8% * weekly distance).
* (**H**ard). Like **I**, but based on time. Pace is by feel of 10-12 min
  racing. For calculation, assume 5 min =~ 1600m. **H** is handy at altitude,
  hitting paces is difficult there.
* **R**epetition. Purpose: improve anaerobic power, speed, running economy.
  Form very important. Hard:recovery ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 (based on time). Other
  suggestion: 400m hard, 400m jog with possible walk the last 10-20 meter.
  Maximum in a single training session: min(8k, 5% * weekly distance). Single
  interval should not exceed ~2 minutes.

# Chapter 10: 1500 to 2 mile training

The 1500 is done at 10-12% higher than VO2max. The 3000 right at VO2max, so
about the pace during I work. (Will depend on how fast you are, evidently)

* Phase I: Skip if you're already good to go. Just E runs, strides, maybe some
  light strength work. The higher distance per week plans have some easy R work
  in the latter 3 weeks too.
* Phase II: One L and two R per week. R pace based on conservative mile race
  estimate.
* Phase III: I and T work. Speed up R pace by 1s per 200m. If feeling good, do
  again in the latter 3 weeks. Can start doing some races.
* Phase IV: Try racing a bunch of shorter ones as free speed work. Update R
  pace with recent race or speed up by 1s per 400m. Mostly R and T work.

# Chapter 11: 5k to 10k training

*Addition to R section: mile pace? He mentions it in PII of his 5k plan. Of
course with other races can just use his VDOT tables.*

Primarily aerobic events. 5k performed at 95-98% of VO2max. 10k performed at
90-94% of VO2max. Maximize aerobic power, move economy, lactate threshold
through mix of R, I, and T.  Which to focus depends on runner. Can only find
out by doing a lot of it.

* Phase I: Basebuilding if you come off a break of running. Skip otherwise.
  Types of run: E, light uphill, strides several times a week. Add L as you get
  further. Some supplemental training can help injury prevention later on.
* Phase II: Focus is on R. For his low plan (64-80k/w): W1 has R, R, L. W2 has
  R, R+T, L. W3 has R, I, M.  Repeat for another 3 weeks to make 6.  For his
  high plan (97-112k/w): W1 has R, R+T+R, L. W2 has  R, R+T, L. W3 has R, I, M.
  Also repeat.
* Phase III: Focus shifts to I. Low and high plan: Alternating L and M. Other
  two Q are back to back (wed-thu): I followed by T or T+R.  If you have a race
  on Sat (what about Sun?), then move the Q-Q up a day or drop the first and
  move the second to Tue.
* Phase IV: Focus T with some R and I here and there. Racing 5ks is good now,
  do not forget the 2-3 days E before and after.  Low plan: L on Sundays.
  Assumes races on Sat. T on Tue. If no race, Fri becomes an I. If race on
  Sunday, move Tue before it to Wed. If race, cut the L the day after to 90m.
  High plan: Same except H instead of I on Fri.

# Chapter 13: Half-Marathon Training

Pace of a half marathon is close to T (if you are fast enough...). Should not
need energy intake to get through it. Fluid intake may be necessary depending
on the weather. Every phase in his plan is six weeks long.

* Phase I: If you have not been running recently. Has E, strides, L. Increase
  distance as you go through it.
* Phase II: Focus on R. Also T since it is so similar to half pace. Rest 1
  minute for every 5-6 T. Throw in E days to fill up. Have an L run per week,
  sometimes an M. Could make it shorter or longer than 6 weeks, but try to keep
  minimum 4.
* Phase III: Toughest. Focus is on I or H. Wed and Thu are Quality days. Wed is
  I or H, alternates per week. Thu is T, sometimes with some R thrown after the
  T parts. Keep at least 4 weeks of this phase. If you have a race in one of
  the weeks, drop the I and move the T to 3-4 days out.
* Phase IV: Focus is on T. Only one Quality session besides the L: variations
  of T workouts on Thu. For a race week: "half your number of 1 mile T sets,
  maximum 3-4 of them". 2-3 days E before the race, 1 E day per 3k raced after
  the race. Again keep minimum 4 weeks of this phase.
