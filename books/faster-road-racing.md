## Chapter 1

Four primary types of training:

1. long runs for endurance: maintaining of faster pace for a longer time,
   needed to handle the other stuff
2. tempo runs for LT pace
3. long intervals for VO2max
4. short intervals for speed and running form

With two extra:

1. general aerobic, increases overall fitness
2. recovery to get ready again for the workouts

## Chapter 3: Supplementary Training (p55)

Optimize training with supplementary workouts (strength, flexibility, other
cardio). Uses different muscles. Helps at mileage ceiling. Helps injury prone
people. Injury is more than true/false. Big grey zone and things inthere can be
annoying without stopping you + may mean worse is to come.

Four types:

- Flexibility (dynamic, static, and "proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation" (PNF))
- Strength training
- Running drills for effective form and posture
- Aerobic cross-training like water running, swimming, and cycling

### Flexibility (p56)

Nobody likes tight/stiff muscles. PNF stretching is for the extreme tightnesses.

#### Dynamic Flexibility

Emphasis on repeatedly moving joint through its range of motion. Most effective
when done before running. Possibly extra useful for the morning runner to shake
off the night. Not a substitute for a warmup before workout/race!

Their routine "should take no more than five minutes". Page 58-60 has photos
and in depth explanation.

- Arm cross: 10 reps
- Leg swing: 15 reps per leg
- Side swing: 15 reps per leg
- Hip circle: 10 reps in each direction
- Knee circle: 10 reps in each direction
- Side skip: 10 reps in each direction

#### Static Flexibility

Lengthen muscle fibres and the connective tissue surrounding them.  Isolate
muscle group and stretch. Perform when muscles are warm and blood flow high
(i.e., after exercise, even as moderate as walking). Do not cause discomfort:
ease off or check technique.

Their routine targets things typical for runners. Stretch symmetrically!
Page 62 onwards has images.

- Back twist: IT band, upper back, lower back
- Leg over: piriformis, lower back
- Butterfly: groin
- Single-leg hamstring reach: hamstring
- Lifted hamstring: hamstring
- Standing quadriceps: quadriceps
- Straight-leg and bent-leg calf: gastrocnemius, soleus
- Arm crossover: upper back, deltoids

#### PNF Stretching

Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation. For particularly tight muscle.
Requires a partner. Two examples given on page 67-68: hamstring stretch and hip
flexor stretch.

### Strength Training (p69)

Do it correctly to not get unwanted (for a runner) side effects. May help
running economy, corrects muscle imbalances, core strength helps your form.
Should do this 2-3 times a week. Lift shortly after or later in the day of a
hard workout. Intensity grouping improves stimulus and gives you more recovery
till next one. Plyometrics are for recovery or GA days, don't want muscles
fatigued. Do not weightlift 24-36 hrs before hard running workout, the fatigue
risks injury.

#### Weight Training

Goals: strengthen muscles and connective tissue, increase muscle stiffness and
injury resilience, correct muscle imbalance, improve running economy.

Two categories:

- isolation exercises: moving only one joint, isolates muscle groups. Many
  require machines. Safe. Corrects muscle imbalance. Does not translate to
  running as easily as rest.
- compound exercises: multiple joints, multiple muscle groups. Uses dumbbells,
  barbells, weight plates. Slightly higher risk of injury. Directer benefits for
  distance runner, especially running economy.

Goal: maximize functional strength, improve running economy, correct muscle
imbalance.

Avoid low weight, high volume.
If lifting makes you too tired to run, scale back the lifting.

They provide a routine for beginners (enables form practice) on page 70 and the
more advanced lifters on page 72.

TODO Actually summarise the routines and when to use which.

#### Core Training

Core = abdominal, lower-back, pelvic, buttocks, oblique muscles.  Stabilises
and balances the body.  More efficient running.  Weak may mean poor posture and
weaker stride.  Strong may reduce lower-leg injuries and enable longer race
pace.

They provide basic and advanced routines. Can switch basic ones out for
advanced ones individually. Perform exercises sequentially, 10-20s break
between each. Do the routine twice. Can also increase reps/time for more
challenge.

Basic:

- Abdominal crunch: 20 reps
- Superman hold: 30 secs
- Fire hydrant: 30 secs (sic, wonder if they accidentally copy pasted, time seems weird here)
- Donkey kick: 10 reps per leg

Advanced:

- Plank: 60s
- Side plank: 30s per side
- Superman crunch: 20 reps
- Supine plank: 45s

Pages 79 to 83 provide explanations on each.

#### Plyometrics

"For runners, no form of strength training has been proven to be more
effective."

Plyometrics = explosive jumping exercises. Increase running economy and racing
performance. When getting into it, don't start at high effort before you
learned all the exercises properly. Doing it right avoids injury. Aim for soft
level surfaces (e.g., grass, track). Keep ground contact minimal. Do it on
fresh days (e.g., GA day), never on or after hard workout day.

Warm up with 1.5-2km running and dynamic stretches. Again they provide a basic
and advanced routine.

### Running Form Drills (p87)

Exaggerate elements of your running stride, isolates, makes more efficient.
Best done after the warm up of an intense workout or race. Strides afterwards.

Basic and advanced routine, do the basic for several weeks as a start. Each
drill to be done twice. FORM MATTERS. Whole routine is about 5 minutes.

Basic:

- A skip: 2×20m
- Butt kick: 2×20m
- High knee: 2×20m
- Quick feet: 2×10m

Advanced:

- B skip: 2×20m
- Backward running: 2×30m
- Carioca: 2×20m each direction

p160: Adjusting training after injury or illness. This is about adjustments
when preparing for a race.
