## Intro

He wants to communicate from researchers to commons. This book is such.  80% of
your runs should be easy, that's what elites do across disciplines.
Ventilatory threshold (77-79% of max hr) should be able to talk there First
part of book is educational, second is practical.

## Chapter 1

Should run slower. Hard to break your faster habit. Do it more (too) often so
it feels natural to run at that pace.  We want to get things done quickly (not
low effort), but also not suffer too much (not high effort). So we do things at
moderate effort. Which is too much effort.  Week of slow: week of superslow
running (start at low distance, gradually build during the week) be very
focused on having it suuuperslow. This will "reset" your perception of easy
running.

## Chapter 2

Two main vars in training: volume and intensity.  Mostly some history here.
Zapotek, Lydiard. Meh.

TODO: script to analyse my runs by HR if possible, pace otherwise, to classify them as easy, mid, and hard. Get a summary for every week ever.

## Chapter 3

Seiler finding out about the ratio and convincing others of the scientific
merit.  States that hiit studies are too short (6wks) and to rigid (always same
exercise, no variation) Conclusion: 80 at low, 20 at high, no need for
moderate. Surprise surprise.

## Chapter 4

Why does it work? No answer yet. Possibly: Low does more than thought, high
does more when plenty of low, or mod and high are too stressful to do a lot.
60% of max hr is minimum for aerobic effect. Further increase brings more..
both are needed for different effects, balanced.  Moderate is worst of both
worlds. Too much stress, not enough benefit.  Vo2max is but one part of the
picture. Battling brain fatigue is there too effort for the brain to keep
focused.

## Chapter 5

How it improves skill. Don't force the "good" form. Just run relaxed and lots.
Don't think about the act of running. Of course, to run relaxed and lots, you need
low effort runs.

## Chapter 6

Three ways to control yourself, pay attention to: perceived effort, heart rate,
pace. (Duh) other things are too impractical.

### Perceived Effort

Perceived effort is how it feels in the head, not the body. Things can hurt in
the body, but it is all about what the brain thinks. In the lab: movement
related cortical perception (MRCP). Perceived effort gets higher during the
run. Only use it at the start to get started, after that use HR or pace. Make
it more important after eg a bad night sleep. Pushing through would make next
days bad too. He gives some cues you can look for to rate your effort.
Basically low remains under Comfortably hard/feel like pushing sliiightly.
Later he will split things up in five zones of two points each.

### Heart Rate

Easy to measure. Supposedly fat burning in fit runners happens around heart
rate of ventilatory threshold. Heart rate is personal for everyone. Zones based
on it are thus also for you individually. The important thing to find out to
set your zones is, to him, the *lactate threshold heart rate*. In his zones, it
is the upper limit of the moderate intensity range. The best way to measure is
in the lab on a treadmill. This may still vary a bit over several days, but
that does not matter too much for training. Luckily, cause that means you can
just measure it yourself in training.

- The 30 minute time trial: warm up decently with easy jogging. Run as much as
  you can in 30 minutes. Average heart rate in final 10 is your LT HR. This
  sucks.
- Via perceived effort: a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Just start at 1 and build up
  till it feels like 6. Heart rate at that point is LT HR. Bit handwavy of
  course.
- Talk test: LT is fastest at which you can comfortably talk. Start slow, after
  a minute recite something, speed up a bit, after a minute recite something,
  speed up, ... When slightly uncomfortable to talk, look at pace and heart
  rate of the previous step. That is your LT HR. Comfortable = breathing is
  normal a few breaths after you stopped talking.

The five zones are as follows (+ example at 170 LT HR):

1. Low aerobic: 75-80% of LT HR (127-136).
2. Moderate aerobic: 81-89% of LT HR (137-151).
3. Threshold: 96-100% of LT HR (163-172).
4. VO2max: 102-105% of LT HR (173-178).
5. Speed: 106+% of LT HR (179+).

The first two are low intensity, below the ventilatory threshold. Moderate is
the third.  High is the two last. The non overlap/continuity is on purpose.

Their purposes:

1. Warmup, cooldown, recovery between intervals, recovery runs.
2. "Foundation runs", i.e. easy runs. Long runs.
3. Tempo runs, cruise intervals, fast finish runs.
4. Interval workouts with longer (2-8min) intervals, fartlek.
5. Interval workouts with shorter (30-90s) intervals, hill reps, intenser fartleks.

LT HR will be a bit higher if you are more fit. So retest if fitness changed
noticeably. HR monitoring is best in the lower zones to hold you back. Higher
zones have cardiac lag anyway, use pace/perceived effort there.

### Pace
