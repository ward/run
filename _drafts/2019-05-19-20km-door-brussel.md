The [Antwerp 10 Miles][antwerp10miles] was my main spring goal. However, I also
signed up for the 20 km door Brussel again. Last year I broke into the top
1000, running 1:27:59 on a hot sunny day. I figured if the weather turned out
better this year, I could easily break that course PR. Not only am I in better
shape, but hot weather also really affects me. As the date drew nearer, the
weather seemed to be almost as good as it can get for running this time of
year: 16ish C, likely cloudy. Guess I would be taking it slightly more
seriously.

## Training

Most of my spring training is detailed in my previous two race reports: first
[Lier][lier], then [Antwerp][antwerp10miles]. In this section I will just
describe the past three weeks since that Antwerp 10 Miles race.

Week one was a recovery week, totalling 55 km. Week two I went back to higher
volume (85 km), but kept intensity at regular running (GA/Recovery). Originally
the Wednesday of week two had the 12 hour relay race of my university planned,
something I took part in the past two years. [Two years ago][12uren2017] I
raced every lap really hard and was sore for ages. [Last year][12uren2018] I
managed to take things a little easier, but also hung around for 6 hours. This
year I had committed to being around the full 12 hours. Due to bad weather
however, they ended up moving the race back a week. Now it fell in the week of
this 20 km race.

I had planned on somewhat training through the 20 km, but not really expected
to run that much just a few days before. Now I did not have much of a choice. I
resolved to run the laps at a really easy pace. Did not quite work out. I ended
up running them around 4:10 pace, faster than my regular running pace. It might
be about my hypothetical marathon pace? I stayed around all day, running 36
laps. I did not run the final hour as I started feeling a weird twitch around
my right ankle. I was willing to sacrifice freshness, but I was not going to
get injured for this. After that Wednesday, I ran 6, 10, and 6 again in the
days before the 20 km race. My legs felt better day after day, but still not
great.

## Goals and Strategy

At first I just wanted to PR, then I figured if the weather was alright, 1:25
should be easily attainable. There is no 1:25 pacer though, but there is a 1:20
one. Based on my Antwerp time, I have a low 1:16 20 km in my legs. Antwerp is,
however, considerably flatter. It crossed my mind to just follow the 1:20
pacer.  The idea was in my head and it was there to stay. I figured I was OK
with blowing up anyway, my spring goal had already passed three weeks earlier.
After a lot of internal debate and bouncing the idea off others, I settled on
it. Follow the 1:20 pacer and see what happens.

## Course Details

Just check the [previous][bxl2015] [race][bxl2016] [reports][bxl2018].

## Pre Race

Nothing really special in the days leading up to it. Just ensured I had a calm
Saturday.

I based my Sunday morning planning on notes from last year. Woke up at 7:00
with race start planned for 10:00.  Had 100g muesli and a cup and a half of
black tea as quickly as I could.  Listened to upbeat 90s music to help wake up.
Tried to use the toilet often enough. Left around 8:30 to head to
Cinquantenaire. It was lightly raining and would do so till the start. Once
there (around 9:15) I passed by the tent of Brussels studentsport. I had signed
up through university and still had to pick up my bib there. Nice extras: I
could easily drop my bag off and afterwards they would provide fruit,
sportdrink, water, ... By 9:30 I went for a little jog around the park to
arrive at my wave. It was raining so I put on my hat. I had a peak at the lines
for the toilet, but decided I did not feel like waiting in line.

Once in the wave, I kept walking around some and doing some stretches to keep
somewhat warm. By 9:50 I squeezed into the crowd, few rows down from the front
line. My coworker (aiming for a sub 1:30) found me and we chatted briefly. I
spotted a 1:20 pacer, but he went into the "elite" corral in front of us. The
other 1:20 pacers joined him there. I was getting worried for a repeat of the
Antwerp 10 Miles pacer mishap, where the pacer I wanted to follow was in some
special separate corral and I never got close to him. Luckily before starting
the race, they removed the barrier between wave 1 and the elite wave, so we
could join up behind them.  I got near one of the pacers and decided he was
going to be the one to follow.  In total I spotted four of them. One on the
other side of the corral I ignored.  One I was standing right behind, we will
call him Start Pacer. The other two were several rows up ahead, we will call
those Fast Pacer and Dropped Pacer for reasons that will become clear later on.

To kill time while we waited for the start signal, I chatted for a bit with an
older man with glasses who was also planning on following the pacer. He was
hoping for really even splits, I preferred them going out slightly slower since
the first part has quite some climbing.

## Race

The gun was shot and we had the usual slow walk towards the starting line. It
is a pretty significant bottleneck so this happens every year. Once we started,
the Start Pacer I had intended on following seemed to have some trouble with the
crowd. Like he had never been in a crowded race. He went at, what felt in those
first few moments, a pedestrian pace and did not weave between people at all. I
figured he would have some trouble for the next km and then be forced to make
up time. I was not in the mood for such an uneven start, so I left Start Pacer
behind and went my own pace, using the gaps I saw. If he did what I suspected,
he would catch up to me again anyway and I could follow him then.

This went smooth enough and not even a kilometre into the race, I noticed I was
already pretty close to the other two pacers (Fast Pacer and Dropped Pacer) I
had seen several rows ahead of me at the start. I decided I would slowly bridge
the gap and roll from there.  About 1.5 km to the race, I was behind them and
feeling confident.

As we turned up in front of the Royal Palace, suddenly someone started talking
to me.  "Hey, I'm the guy who messaged you on reddit". About 10 days earlier
someone had asked me a question about group runs in Brussels. He had recognised
my ARTC singlet. I was a bit weirded out at first, but we made conversation the
next few 100 metre. Turns out he did not know the course, so I gave him a quick
overview of what to expect. I noticed I had fallen behind slightly on the
pacers while talking and did a quick speed up to be back with them. I looked
around and realised the guy had not followed. Oh well. We turned in front of
the Palace of Justice and I spotted a km marker for the first time.

{% include racesplit.html content='
Split at the 3 km marker was 12:05, so 4:01-4:02 average for the first three km.
On pace for a 1:20:xx.
The first 3 km goes a bit up and down but you end up around the same height as you started so I was OK with that pace.
' %}

After this you pretty quickly drop into a first of three tunnels. Part of the
reason I decided to go for solely manual lapping on this race. I stick close to
the two pacers through the first tunnel. Heading into the second tunnel, the
pacers are no longer sticking together. I decide to follow the faster one, Fast
Pacer, of the two. After the second tunnel, I spot another km marker.

{% include racesplit.html content='
From 3 to 5 km was done in 7:55. Sub 4:00s while going uphill and two tunnels thrown in.
Cumulative 20:00 for the first 5 km which translates to a round 1:20:00.
' %}

I see the split time on my watch and notice Fast Pacer has no goal of slowing
down some.  I decide this pacer is going faster than I wanted to go.  With all
the climbing in this half I expected to go out slightly _slower_ than goal
pace, not faster.  I always go out too fast in this race when pacing myself. Is
it ironic that the one time I do not is when I decide to first follow and then
ignore the pacer? I do not think too much about what pace I am holding, but I
let the pacer go. I figure Dropped Pacer would catch up to me anyway if it
turns out I went too slow.

We enter Terkamerenbos and I start feeling the effort a little. However, I know
there will be some reprieve soon and just try to stay consistent.  Before we
reach the top around the 7 km mark, I spot Dropped Pacer in the corner of my
eye. I ensure I stay either abreast with or in front of him.  We reach the top
and I spot another distance marker.

{% include racesplit.html content='
From 5 to 7 km was done in 7:57. Still sub 4:00s, still uphill.
' %}

Next there is some reprieve as we blast down a hill. There are some bumps back
upwards, but most of the next 3 km can probably be described as descending.
Somewhere around here we pass an aid station with only sports drinks. I recall
a note from last year's race report in which I stated drinking two sips of the
sports drink gave me a heavy feeling in the gut. I ignore this aid station. Not
like I really need to drink much on a 20 km race that is not blazing hot.

Nothing really happens in this section, I spot Dropped Pacer in the corner of
my eye on the uphill parts, drop him again on the downhill parts. 

{% include racesplit.html content='
Halfway in 39:21, so estimated finish time is double that: 1:18:42.
Previous 5 km was in 19:21.
Split 7 to 9 km was 7:09, but I think they might have placed the sign for the 9 km a bit too early (going by the GPS length of this lap and the next).
Tenth km was 4:15, but likely a bit long then.
' %}

I passed the midway point quite ahead of the 1:20 goal I had in mind. After a
last little bump you can enjoy some downhill for quite a while to recover. In
previous editions I have managed to be sometimes be so dead by this point that
I could not even enjoy a speedy downhill recovery. Today, I felt largely
alright and was already starting to feel pretty sure about going sub 1:20.
First that little bump though.

After passing the 10 km mark, you climb up for about 1.5 km again. The height
difference is negligible compared to what you have done so far, but if you blew
up some already, this really sucks. As it stands, I was alright. At that point,
something a little fucked up happened.

The road is turning left here and for the next several kilometres. If you are
running tangents, you aim for the inside of that turn of course.  This is made
slightly more difficult by the charity runners you pass. There is this thing
where a group will push somebody (mostly mentally) handicapped in a special
wheelchair. They start before the race starts, so you spend most of the race
passing different groups. This goes well, if sometimes a bit tight.  This
particular group was taking up the inner two lanes of the left turn we were in.
There are three car lanes total.  Usually there are some gaps to squeeze
in-between, but not so with this group.  Some other runner almost bumped into
one of the group's runners. The group's runner gets really mad and yells at the
guy that "there is another lane to the right for you to use". I retort "use it
then" as I pass the group's runner myself.  I figure they are not in it to race
nor to run a particular time. The guy must not have appreciated my comment as I
suddenly see a half full water bottle flying past me and hitting a runner in
the legs. Shit, dude, take some anger management classes.

Either way, I was alright and crested the little hill shortly after. Nothing
really happened the next few kilometre as we went either downhill or on
flattish grounds. In retrospect I maybe should have tried pushing this part a
bit more. I do not quite remember how I felt.

{% include racesplit.html content='
Splits 11 through 16 at 3:48, 4:02, 3:29, 3:48, 3:57, and 3:55.
That makes the 5 km split 19:04.
' %}

After 16 km my predicted finish time was just sub 1:18 (I notice that now, I
did not make that calculation during the run). Of course, the Tervurenlaan was
still to come, starting around the 17th kilometre and ending around 18.5.
Before making the turn onto the Tervurenlaan, I see Fast Pacer in the distance
jogging backwards. I guess he realised he was way ahead of the 1:20 he was
pacing. I hope those that actually followed him did not blow up completely
before the climb to come.

We start the climb and I try to find a pace where I do not blow up, but also am
not my usual slow climbing self. The not blowing up part seems to work at
least. I do seem to recall my legs burning a little, though I am not sure at
what point it happened.  Suddenly I notice someone to the left of me that I
recognise: the older guy with glasses from right before the start. It is clear
he is going up the hill faster than I am and I decide to just follow him till
the top.  This speed-up does not feel particularly bad, so I must not have been
climbing fast enough. Eventually we get past the hill and I decide it is time
to immediately kick up the pace again.

{% include racesplit.html content='
Missed the 17 km marker, bit of a pity since that should be around the start of the climb.
18 km marker split at 8:26.
Eyeballing it I would say the 17th km was just sub 4:00 again, which would make the 18th around 4:30.
' %}

While I am pressing the lap button whenever I see a km marker, I am not really
paying attention to the time that is shown on the watch face. Just trying to
push out an effort I think I can carry till the end.  I think I only pass
people in this section.  Fast Pacer jogs backwards some more and I pass him
too.  The cobbles at the end are annoying as always, but I get through them
without doing something dumb with my ankles.

## Results

[Official results][results] peg me at 1:18:20, [Strava][strava] agrees. The
last two km were done in 3:49 and 3:46. I finished 287th out of 30k finishers.
I took a quick breather, got a banana, some water, my medal. I thanked Fast
Pacer and Dropped Pacer, but pointed out Fast Pacer went way too fast. He
apologised. I realised I felt alright. Too alright? After other editions I was
always feeling rather dead.  Now I went for a recovery jog and felt... fine.
It put a slight damper on largely satisfied feelings. Could I easily have done
much better still? A week later I am still not sure how I feel about it.  I
likely will not soon be this lucky with the weather again so this course PR
will probably stand for a few years.  It would be a shame if it was not the
best I could do on the day.  My jog ended at the studentsport stand where I
changed and happily used the food and drinks they provided.

The winner did it in 1:00:34. I would have needed a 1:12:51 for the top 100 and
a 1:16:34 for the top 200. Still lots of room for improvement. The female
winner ran 1:13:04. Of the women, I only had to let the podium finish ahead of
me.

The older guy with glasses finished in 1:18:36. The coworker aiming for sub
1:30 succeeded in his goal (1:28:44), but my own PRing doubled the timegap
between us. As long as no crazy runner joins the office, I should be safe for
now.

## Future

This ends my spring. I guess next up I should follow through on my "try out a
1500-3000m plan" idea.  I also should start thinking about what race I want to
make my fall goal though. That will definitely shape my plans.  I am leaning
towards a flat and certified half marathon. Finding a track race around my
level would also be nice though.
