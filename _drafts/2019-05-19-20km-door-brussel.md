The [Antwerp 10 Miles][antwerp10miles] was my main spring goal. However, I also
signed up for the 20 km door Brussel again. Last year I broke into the top
1000, running 1:27:59 on a hot sunny day. I figured if the weather turned out
better this year, I could easily PR. Not only am I in better shape, but hot
weather also really affects me. As the date drew nearer, the weather seemed to
be almost as good as it can get for this time of year. Guess I would be taking
it slightly more seriously.

## Training

Most of my spring training is detailed in my previous two race reports: first
[Lier][lier], then [Antwerp][antwerp10miles]. In this section I will just
describe the past three weeks since that Antwerp 10 Miles race.

Week one was a recovery week, totalling 55 km. Week two I went back to higher
volume (85 km), but kept intensity at regular running (GA/Recovery). Originally
the Wednesday of week two had the 12 hour relay race of my university planned,
something I took part in the past two years. [Two years ago][12uren2017] I
raced every lap really hard and was sore for ages. [Last year][12uren2018] I
managed to take things a little easier, but also hung around for 6 hours. This
year I had committed to being around the full 12 hours. Due to bad weather
however, they ended up moving the race back a week. Now it fell in the week of
this 20 km race.

I had planned on somewhat training through the 20 km, but not really expected
to run that much just a few days before. Now I did not have much of a choice. I
resolved to run the laps at a really easy pace. Did not quite work out. I ended
up running them around 4:10 pace, faster than my regular running pace, it might
be about my hypothetical marathon pace. I stayed around all day, running 36
laps. I did not run the final hour as I started feeling a weird twitch around
my right ankle. I was willing to sacrifice freshness, but I was not going to
get injured for this. After that Wednesday, I ran 6, 10, and 6 again in the
days before the 20 km race. My legs felt better day after day, but still not
great.

## Goals and Strategy

At first I just wanted to PR, then I figured if the weather was alright, 1:25
should be easily attainable. There is no 1:25 pacer though, but there is a 1:20
one.  Based on my Antwerp time, I have a 1:16 low 20 km in my legs. Antwerp is,
however, considerably flatter. It crossed my mind to just follow the 1:20
pacer.  The idea was in my head and it was there to stay. I figured I was OK
with blowing up anyway, my spring goal had already passed three weeks earlier.
After a lot of internal debate and bouncing the idea off others, I settled on
it. Follow the 1:20 pacer and see what happens.

## Course Details

Just check the previous race reports.

<!-- TODO Link those old ones -->

## Pre Race

Nothing really special in the days leading up to it. Just ensured I had a calm
Saturday.

I based my Sunday morning planning on notes from last year. Woke up at 7:00
with race start planned for 10:00.  Had 100g muesli and a cup and a half of
black tea as quickly as I could.  Listened to upbeat 90s music to help wake up.
Tried to use the toilet often enough. Left around 8:30 to head to
Cinquantenaire. It was lightly raining and would do so till the start. Once
there (around 9:15) I passed by the tent of Brussels studentsport. I had signed
up through university and still had to pick up my bib there. Nice extras: I
could easily drop my bag there and afterwards there would be more fruit,
sportdrink, water, ... By 9:30 I went for a little jog around the park to
arrive at my wave. Had a peak at the lines for the toilet, but decided I did
not feel like waiting in line.

Once in the wave, I kept walking around some and doing some stretches to keep
somewhat warm. By 9:50 I squeezed into the crowd, few rows down from the front
line. My coworker (aiming for a sub 1:30) found me and we chatted briefly. I
spotted a 1:20 pacer, but he went into the "elite" corral in front of us. The
other 1:20 pacers joined him there. I was getting worried for a repeat of the
Antwerp 10 Miles pacer mishap, where the pacer I wanted to follow was in some
special separate corral and I never got close to him. Luckily before starting
the race, they removed the barrier between wave 1 and the elite wave, so we
could join up behind them.  I got near one of the pacers and decided he was
going to be the one to follow.  In total I spotted four of them. One on the
other side of the corral I ignored.  One I was standing right behind, we will
call him Start Pacer. The other two were several rows up ahead, we will call
those Fast Pacer and Dropped Pacer for reasons that will become clear later on.

To kill time while we waited for the start signal, I chatted for a bit with an
older man with glasses who was also planning on following the pacer. He was
hoping for really even splits, I preferred them going out slightly slower since
the first part has quite some climbing.

## Race

The gun was shot and we had the usual slow walk towards the starting line. It
is a pretty significant bottleneck so this happens every year. Once we started,
the Start Pacer I had intended on following seemed to have some trouble with the
crowd. Like he had never been in a crowded race. He went at, what felt in those
first few moments, a pedestrian pace and did not weave between people at all. I
figured he would have some trouble for the next km and then be forced to make
up time. I was not in the mood for such an uneven start, so I left Start Pacer
behind and went my own pace, using the gaps I saw. If he did what I suspected,
he would catch up to me again anyway and I could follow him then.

This went smooth enough and not even a kilometre into the race, I noticed I was
already pretty close to the other two pacers (Fast Pacer and Dropped Pacer) I
had seen several rows ahead of me at the start. I decided I would slowly bridge
the gap and roll from there.  About 1.5 km to the race, I was behind them and
feeling confident.

As we turned up in front of the Royal Palace, suddenly someone started talking
to me.  "Hey, I'm the guy who messaged you on reddit". About 10 days earlier
someone had asked me a question about group runs in Brussels. He had recognised
my ARTC singlet. I was a bit weirded out at first, but we made conversation the
next few 100 metre. Turns out he did not know the course, so I gave him a quick
overview of what to expect. I noticed I had fallen behind slightly on the
pacers while talking and did a quick speed up to be back with them. I looked
around and realised the guy had not followed. Oh well. We turned in front of
the Palace of Justice and I spotted a km marker for the first time.

{% include racesplit.html content='
Split at the 3 km marker was 12:05, so 4:01-4:02 average for the first three km.
On pace for a 1:20:xx.
The first 3 km goes a bit up and down but you end up around the same height as you started so I was OK with that pace.
' %}

After this you pretty quickly drop into a first of three tunnels. Part of the
reason I decided to go for solely manual lapping on this race. I stick close to
the two pacers through the first tunnel. Heading into the second tunnel, the
pacers are no longer sticking together. I decide to follow the faster one, Fast
Pacer, of the two. After the second tunnel, I spot another km marker.

{% include racesplit.html content='
From 3 to 5 km was done in 7:55. Sub 4:00s while going uphill and two tunnels thrown in.
Cumulative 20:00 for the first 5 km which translates to a round 1:20:00.
' %}

I see the split time on my watch and notice Fast Pacer has no goal of slowing
down some.  I decide this pacer is going faster than I wanted to go.  With all
the climbing in this half I expected to go out slightly _slower_ than goal
pace, not faster.  I always go out too fast in this race when pacing myself. Is
it ironic that the one time I do not is when I decide to first follow and then
ignore the pacer? I do not think too much about what pace I am holding, but I
let the pacer go. I figure Dropped Pacer would catch up to me anyway if it
turns out I went too slow.

We enter Terkamerenbos and I start feeling the effort a little. However, I know
there will be some reprieve soon and just try to stay consistent.  Before we
reach the top around the 7 km mark, I spot Dropped Pacer in the corner of my
eye. I ensure I stay either abreast with or in front of him.  We reach the top
and I spot another distance marker.

{% include racesplit.html content='
From 5 to 7 km was done in 7:57. Still sub 4:00s, still uphill.
' %}

Next there is some reprieve as we blast down a hill. There are some bumps back
upwards, but most of the next 3 km can probably be described as descending.
Somewhere around here we pass an aid station with only sports drinks. I recall
a note from last year's race report in which I stated drinking two sips of the
sports drink gave me a heavy feeling in the gut. I ignore this aid station. Not
like I really need to drink much on a 20 km race that is not blazing hot.

Nothing really happens in this section, I spot Dropped Pacer in the corner of
my eye on the uphill parts, drop him again on the downhill parts. 

{% include racesplit.html content='
Halfway in 39:21, so estimated finish time is double that: 1:18:42.
Previous 5 km was in 19:21.
Split 7 to 9 km was 7:09, but I think they might have placed the sign for the 9 km a bit too early (going by the GPS length of this lap and the next).
Tenth km was 4:15, but likely a bit long then.

Bottle thrower.

??? Did anything else even happen till seeing the pacer turn backwards?
