The big one. The spring goal. The "[20 km door Brussel][officialsite]" (a.k.a.
20 km de Bruxelles a.k.a. 20 km of Brussels). Last year I ran it in 1h 30m 41s
and injured myself in the process, getting sidelined for about six weeks. This
year had to be better, both in terms of time as in terms of getting there
safely.

## About the Race

This is by far the most iconic race in Belgium. Its first edition was in 1980,
admittedly not exceptionally long ago, and since then they have been organising
the 20 km race on the last Sunday of May.  Other distances are not considered,
this is the only race they offer. No diluting the field, either you are here
for the 20 km, or you do not matter.

With up to 40,000 participants on this one distance, this also makes it one of the
largest races in the world. Needless to say, people in Belgium tend to know what you
refer to when you mention you will run "de 20km".

## Training

As training I followed Pete Pfitzinger's lowest half marathon plan. The
difference in racing between the two distances is negligible after all. His
lowest plan starts around 50 km per week and peaks at 76 km. This had me
slightly worried beforehand as I had only started running 50 km per week
consistently at the beginning of the year. Not to mention those 50 km included
considerably less workouts than what "Uncle Pete" had set out for me. I
also allowed [some modifications][pfitzmods] (and [modifications on the
modifications][meiserace]) on the plan to fit in my tune-up race schedule.

Following the plan went, luckily, mostly flawless. There was a short sickspell
with antibiotics in week three. I had to cut my second VO2max workout, in the
peak week, short due to general tiredness and warm weather. My tune-up races
were not going as smoothly as I hoped (though people assured me training
through a race can be a pain). Beyond these things though, I would say the plan
managed to challenge me in what I think was a good way.

Besides the plan, I also tried to keep on bike commuting. In a normal week this
amounts to about 100 km, but due to the sickness and other circumstances (being
abroad, bike broken, resting for a race), it averaged out to being about 50 km
per week. Sounds more substantial than it is.

## Course details

Start and finish is in the Parc du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a Jubelpark a.k.a.
Jubileepark) in six waves of up to 6,000 people. You run towards the Konink
Paleis van Brussel (a.k.a. Palais de Bruxelles a.k.a. Royal Palace) which you
hit around two kilometre in. At the palace you are also greeted with cobbles
for several 100 metre, but you can try to avoid that by sneaking onto the side
walk. You head towards the Palais de Justice (a.k.a. Justitiepaleis a.k.a.
Palace of Justice), likely the largest building that was built in the 19th
century anywhere in the world.

After reaching it, you are three kilometre into the race and a climb starts
towards Ter Kamerenbos (a.k.a. Bois de la Cambre a.k.a. La Cambre Forest")
ending in it at 7.5 km after which things flatten out somewhat. You leave this
park/forest around kilometre ten and now stick to one road for the next seven
kilometre.

This road features some net downhill, which is always welcome, and slowly
circles you back in the direction of the Parc du Cinquantenaire. At the
seventeen km mark you turn left onto the Tervurenlaan (a.k.a. Avenue de
Tervuren a.k.a. Tervuren Lane), a road many runners refer to with dread. Dread,
because soon after turning and over the course of about one kilometre, you are
handed forty metres of elevation. Painful if you are already at your limits. On
the plus side, once you are past it, you can see the finish which is only 1.5
km of straight road (with some roundabouts) away at that point. The finish is
under the Arcades du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a. Triomfboog van het Jubelpark a.k.a.
the Arch of the Jubileepark), ready to make you feel small just when you felt
good about yourself.

## Goals and Strategy

I had only one goal before the race: running the entire thing in 85 minutes (1h
25m). I thought about listing other things here as well, "back up" goals, but
when thinking about it, I realise anything less would be a disappointment.
Uncle Pete's plan had brought me to race day brimming with confidence.

As such, the strategy was simple enough. Start out at 4:15/km pace for the
first ten kilometre. Check at the halfway point whether going faster is still
an option. Do not die.

## Morning of the Race

The girlfriend and I got up at seven. I still had the sore throat I had been
nursing the past week, though I did not consider it to be able to really hamper
my goal. The usual habits were followed, some slices of bread with américain
préparé, lots of water, and getting things ready while waiting around for the
bodily functions to kick in.

We were out the door around half past eight to catch the metro. Arriving at the
metro station near the start, we caught the first signs of the big crowd we
would have to deal with the rest of the day. A big blob of people was queuing
up for the exits and none of the queues seemed to be making any progress.
Worse, a minute after our metro, another metro was going to arrive, likely also
filled to the brim with runners. Unwilling to wait around with no progress, I
led us to a closed exit which quickly brought us to the platform on the other
side, for metros in the opposite direction. The crowd here was considerably
smaller and, more importantly, actually moving forward.  We exited right at the
Parc du Cinquantenaire and into even more crowds. A quick trip to the bathroom
and some wading through the crowds later, we did a short warm-up and eventually
went to our corral with about five to ten minutes to spare for the start.

After the traditional playing of the Bolero by Ravel ended, the Belgian national
anthem was played. Then, finally, the start shot was given at 10:00. Let the race
begin!

Well. Almost. As mentioned before, our corral still had up to 6,000 people and
all of us had to pass by a rather small bottleneck that is the exit of the
park. It took us another four minutes (!) to actually cross the start line. I
said bye to the girlfriend, who was aiming for 1:27, and off we were. For
realsies.

## Race

Oh how I hate the crowds. From the start (and, spoiler alert, till the end),
there was no way around a group of people. There is just about never a bunch of
open space. You are constantly weaving between others and others weave past
you. It is a total clusterfuck. Every possible gap is used, ribbons are jumped
over or ducked under to get on the sidewalk just to have that little bit of
extra room. There are simply so many people and, especially those first
kilometres, you are constantly between people trying to find their pace. One
person's pace never seems to match the pace of the other people nearby or, at
least, my pace.

After two and a half kilometre you reach the first water stand. You are also on
wonderful Belgian cobbles at this point. Add to that all the water being thrown
around and the cobbles quickly become very wet. In case you have never encountered
a wet cobbled road: it is slippery. Luckily the cobbles did not last much longer
and before long you turn unto Avenue Louise.

> Kilometre one in 4:18, kilometre two in 4:13, kilometre three in 4:26.

So far so good, as I manage to hit the paces I had set out to hit. Things also
get slightly better on Avenue Louise in terms of the crowd's pace, it is bound
to be more similar to yours by now. There are also no more turns to be
concerned about for the next few kilometre, it is a straight line.

Even so, someone in front of me decides to plant more than just his body
against the pavement as he miscalculates a hop onto the sidewalk. He quickly
jumps back up again as another guy and I ask him "Ça va?" ("Are you OK?") in
chorus. He grunts and continues on.

While it is straight, this road features some tunnels and just like last year
getting out of them is the most annoying part. It is pretty steep. My heart
rate started rising towards 180 which is, I think, around the edge of VO2max
for me. Not 100% sure, but either way it is a bit high for me. Despite this, I
saw things were not going smoothly as my splits remained above what I needed to
hit for 1h25. I went through the first 7km about 1m30s too slow, but was not
too worried yet as the second half of the race is easier than the first.

> Kilometre four in 4:25, kilometre five in 4:54, kilometre six in 4:13,
> kilometre seven in 4:50. Official five km split at 22:07.

Around the point where we entered the Terkamerenbos I decided some consistency
would be nice and, realising I am often pretty bad at pacing, started tailing a
random guy that seemed like he might be knowing what he was doing. This went
well for a bit, but I lost track of him at the next water stand. The volunteers
there seemed unprepared and undermanned on one side... my side. I noticed I was
about to not get any water, so decided to grab a bottle from their bottle packs
myself. I grabbed for one, but my grip on it was not tight enough and it fell
from the pack unto the ground. I did a quick break, turn around, grab bottle,
turn around, start again. Just what I needed when the pacing is not going entirely
as planned. At least I had some water to throw over my head.

We passed the time mat for the halfway point, but my watch was still quite a
bit away from ten kilometre. This briefly gave me hope, thinking my watch was
just fucking up. A bit further we passed the actual sign for the ten kilometre.
I guess the people placing the signs and the people placing the mats were not
in sync. Either way, hopes shattered.

> Kilometre eight in 4:39, kilometre nine in 4:37, kilometre ten in 4:35.
> Official "ten km" split at 43:35.

I was not as much aware of these splits during the race as may seem to be the
case in my telling here. I knew things were going slower than I had set out to
do, but the actual numbers did not really register. The thing that did register
time and time again was the fact that my heart rate remained consistently too
close to 180.

The next few kilometres were done on autopilot. I am sitting here and for the
life of me cannot really pinpoint what happened at this point in the race. Just
chugging along. There was a bit of a downhill at some point which the
handicapped people in their handibikes took advantage from, they zoomed past,
having to brake to safely navigate the crowd. I guess that does give me a point
to raise. There are charities pushing a buggy along with someone incapable of
moving themselves in the buggy. This would be OK if it were not for the fact
that these groups take up *so much room*. They also let them start at the
front, regardless of their pace. In a race this crowded, this makes for
needless extra weaving for the other runners. Let them start even earlier (they
currently start 15 minutes before the first wave) or put them where they belong
pace wise.

> Kilometre eleven in 4:43, kilometre twelve in 4:33, kilometre thirteen in
> 4:26.

After about 14 kilometre, I decided to just ignore my pacing altogether. It was
clear to me my goal was out the window. I switched my watch to only show my heart
rate and managed to bring it down a few beats. This apparently immediately shows
up in my paces too.

> Kilometre fourteen in 4:33, kilometre fifteen in 4:43, kilometre sixteen in
> 4:44, kilometre seventeen in 4:49. Their official 15 km split says 1:07:06.

After very long stretch of autopilot, we turned onto the Tervurenlaan. This
meant climbing was to be done.  Last year I cruised through this, not really
losing any pace as I went up it. This year was disastrous.  I slowed down to a
5:25 split and was just so happy when I crested (the worst of) the hill.

Inexplicably the last few kilometres to the line are done on a terribly narrow
stretch. Two cars wide tops. If you plan on sprinting to the line, you best
prepare to get your elbows ready in order to squeeze through. I had no such
plans and just chugged further.

> Kilometre eighteen in 5:25, kilometre nineteen in 4:36.

Suddenly however, with about one kilometre to go, I saw someone in front of me
that could be the girlfriend.  Upon further inspection, it really was her. How
did that happen, why was she in front of me?! I had settled with having a
disappointing time, but I will not get beaten by her! I would hear about it for
ages.  With renewed energy, I decided to sprint to the finish line. As I passed
her, I gave her a tap on the shoulder said "damnit!" or something similar and
raced away.  Surprised with what I still managed, I made my way through the
crowd, running on narrow sidewalk edges, hopping on and off like a madman.  I
squeezed through gaps that were not there, to the malcontent of other runners.
I was a bit rude, I must admit, but at the time I had but one goal: keep the
girlfriend behind me.

I crossed the line and immediately came to a halt. I stopped my watch and saved
the run. I forgot to even look at my time, so automated is the stop and save
motion. I knew it was going to be bad, I just had no clue how bad exactly.
Considering the girlfriend was so close behind, I imagined I would still be
around her goal time of 1:27:30 then.

## Results

It was not. Not even close. My official time was 1h 30m 40s, Strava agrees.
Exactly one second better than last year. I can only say this was a
disappointment across the line.  I trained harder. I trained smarter. I barely
did better. I could try to blame it on the warmer weather (20C & clouded, last months
I was used to running at maybe 12C max), I could try to blame it on the sore
throat I had all week, but in the end this does not make me feel better about
the result. It is what it is and it is much slower than I hoped. The only
uplifting news I find for myself is that I did about 500 spots better than last
year: 2345th. It seems I was not the only one having more trouble than last year.

Plans to come

* Too crowded unless you are one of the first 1000 or so, I think
* Too much chance of the weather not being to my liking at the end of May
