The big one. The spring goal. The "[20 km door Brussel][officialsite]" (a.k.a.
20 km de Bruxelles a.k.a. 20 km of Brussels). Last year I ran it in 1h 30m 41s
and injured myself in the process, getting sidelined for about six weeks. This
year had to be better, both in terms of time as in terms of getting there
safely.

## About the Race

This is by far the most iconic race in Belgium. Its first edition was in 1980,
admittedly not exceptionally long ago, and since then they have been organising
the 20 km race on the last Sunday of May.  Other distances are not considered,
this is the only race they offer. No diluting the field, either you are here
for the 20 km, or you do not matter.

With up to 40,000 participants on this one distance, this also makes it one of the
largest races in the world. Needless to say, people in Belgium tend to know what you
refer to when you mention you will run "de 20km".

## Training

As training I followed Pete Pfitzinger's lowest half marathon plan. The
difference in racing between the two distances is negligible after all. His
lowest plan starts around 50 km per week and peaks at 76 km. This had me
slightly worried beforehand as I had only started running 50 km per week
consistently at the beginning of the year. Not to mention those 50 km included
considerably less workouts than what "Uncle Pete" had set out for me. I
also allowed [some modifications][pfitzmods] (and [modifications on the
modifications][meiserace]) on the plan to fit in my tune-up race schedule.

Following the plan went, luckily, mostly flawless. There was a short sickspell
with antibiotics in week three. I had to cut my second VO2max workout, in the
peak week, short due to general tiredness and warm weather. My tune-up races
were not going as smoothly as I hoped (though people assured me training
through a race can be a pain). Beyond these things though, I would say the plan
managed to challenge me in what I think was a good way.

Besides the plan, I also tried to keep on bike commuting. In a normal week this
amounts to about 100 km, but due to the sickness and other circumstances (being
abroad, bike broken, resting for a race), it averaged out to being about 50 km
per week. Sounds more substantial than it is.

## Course details

Start and finish is in the Parc du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a Jubelpark a.k.a.
Jubileepark) in six waves of up to 6,000 people. You run towards the Konink
Paleis van Brussel (a.k.a. Palais de Bruxelles a.k.a. Royal Palace) which you
hit around two kilometre in. At the palace you are also greeted with cobbles
for several 100 metre, but you can try to avoid that by sneaking onto the side
walk. You head towards the Palais de Justice (a.k.a. Justitiepaleis a.k.a.
Palace of Justice), likely the largest building that was built in the 19th
century anywhere in the world.

After reaching it, you are three kilometre into the race and a climb starts
towards Ter Kamerenbos (a.k.a. Bois de la Cambre a.k.a. La Cambre Forest")
ending in it at 7.5 km after which things flatten out somewhat. You leave this
park/forest around kilometre ten and now stick to one road for the next seven
kilometre.

This road features some net downhill, which is always welcome, and slowly
circles you back in the direction of the Parc du Cinquantenaire. At the
seventeen km mark you turn left onto the Tervurenlaan (a.k.a. Avenue de
Tervuren a.k.a. Tervuren Lane), a road many runners refer to with dread. Dread,
because soon after turning and over the course of about one kilometre, you are
handed forty metres of elevation. Painful if you are already at your limits. On
the plus side, once you are past it, you can see the finish which is only 1.5
km of straight road (with some roundabouts) away at that point. The finish is
under the Arcades du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a. Triomfboog van het Jubelpark a.k.a.
the Arch of the Jubileepark), ready to make you feel small just when you felt
good about yourself.

## Goals and Strategy

I had only one goal before the race: running the entire thing in 85 minutes (1h
25m). I thought about listing other things here as well, "back up" goals, but
when thinking about it, I realise anything less would be a disappointment.
Uncle Pete's plan had brought me to race day brimming with confidence.

As such, the strategy was simple enough. Start out at 4:15/km pace for the
first ten kilometre. Check at the halfway point whether going faster is still
an option. Do not die.

## Morning of the Race

The girlfriend and I got up at seven. I still had the sore throat I had been
nursing the past week, though I did not consider it to be able to really hamper
my goal. The usual habits were followed, some slices of bread with américain
préparé, lots of water, and getting things ready while waiting around for the
bodily functions to kick in.

We were out the door around half past eight to catch the metro. Arriving at the
metro station near the start, we caught the first signs of the big crowd we
would have to deal with the rest of the day. A big blob of people was queuing
up for the exits and none of the queues seemed to be making any progress.
Worse, a minute after our metro, another metro was going to arrive, likely also
filled to the brim with runners. Unwilling to wait around with no progress, I
led us to a closed exit which quickly brought us to the platform on the other
side, for metros in the opposite direction. The crowd here was considerably
smaller and, more importantly, actually moving forward.  We exited right at the
Parc du Cinquantenaire and into even more crowds. A quick trip to the bathroom
and some wading through the crowds later, we did a short warm-up and eventually
went to our corral with about five to ten minutes to spare for the start.

After the traditional playing of the Bolero by Ravel ended, the Belgian national
anthem was played. Then, finally, the start shot was given at 10:00. Let the race
begin!

Well. Almost. As mentioned before, our corral still had up to 6,000 people and
all of us had to pass by a rather small bottleneck that is the exit of the
park. It took us another four minutes (!) to actually cross the start line. I
said bye to the girlfriend, who was aiming for 1:27, and off we were. For
realsies.

## Race

Oh how I hate the crowds. From the start (and, spoiler alert, till the end),
there was no way around a group of people. There is just about never a bunch of
open space. You are constantly weaving between others and others weave past
you. It is a total clusterfuck. Every possible gap is used, ribbons are jumped
over or ducked under to get on the sidewalk just to have that little bit of
extra room. There are simply so many people and, especially those first
kilometres, you are constantly between people trying to find their pace. One
person's pace never seems to match the pace of the other people nearby or, at
least, my pace.

After two and a half kilometre you reach the first water stand. You are also on
wonderful Belgian cobbles at this point. Add to that all the water being thrown
around and the cobbles quickly become very wet. In case you have never encountered
a wet cobbled road: it is slippery. Luckily the cobbles did not last much longer
and before long you turn unto Avenue Louise.

> Kilometre one in x:xx, kilometre two in x:xx, kilometre three in x:xx.

So far so good, as I manage to hit the paces I had set out to hit. Things also
get slightly better on Avenue Louise in terms of the crowd's pace, it is bound
to be more similar to yours by now. There are also no more turns to be
concerned about for the next few kilometre, it is a straight line.

## Results

* Too crowded unless you are one of the first 1000 or so, I think
* Too much chance of the weather not being to my liking at the end of May
