The big one. The spring goal. The "[20 km door Brussel][officialsite]" (a.k.a.
20 km de Bruxelles a.k.a. 20 km of Brussels). Last year I ran it in 1h 30m 41s
and injured myself in the process, getting sidelined for about six weeks. This
year had to be better, both in terms of time as in terms of getting there
safely.

## About the Race

This is by far the most iconic race in Belgium. Its first edition was in 1980
and since then they have been organising the 20 km race on the last Sunday of May.
Other distances are not considered, this is the only race they offer. No diluting
the field, either you are here for the 20 km, or you do not matter.

With up to 40,000 participants on this one distance, this also makes it one of the
largest races in the world. Needless to say, people in Belgium tend to know what you
refer to when you mention you will run "de 20km".

## Training

As training I followed Pete Pfitzinger's lowest half marathon plan. The
difference in racing between the two distances is negligible after all. His
lowest plan starts around 50 km per week and peaks at 76 km. This had me
slightly worried beforehand as I had only started running 50 km per week
consistently at the beginning of the year. Not to mention those 50 km included
considerably less workouts than what "Uncle Pete" had set out for me. I
also allowed [some modifications][pfitzmods] (and [modifications on the
modifications][meiserace]) on the plan to fit in my tune-up race schedule.

Following the plan went, luckily, mostly flawless. There was a short sickspell
with antibiotics in week three. I had to cut my second VO2max workout, in the
peak week, short due to general tiredness and warm weather. My tune-up races
were not going as smoothly as I hoped (though people assured me training
through a race can be a pain). Beyond these things though, I would say the plan
managed to challenge me in what I think was a good way.

Besides the plan, I also tried to keep on bike commuting. In a normal week this
amounts to about 100 km, but due to the sickness and other circumstances (being
abroad, bike broken, resting for a race), it averaged out to being about 50 km
per week. Sounds more substantial than it is.

## Course details

Start and finish is in the Parc du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a Jubelpark a.k.a.
Jubileepark) in six waves of up to 6,000 people. You run towards the Konink
Paleis van Brussel (a.k.a. Palais de Bruxelles a.k.a. Royal Palace) which you
hit around two kilometre in. At the palace you are also greeted with cobbles
for several 100 metre, but you can try to avoid that by sneaking onto the side
walk. You head towards the Palais de Justice (a.k.a. Justitiepaleis a.k.a.
Palace of Justice), likely the largest building that was built in the 19th
century anywhere in the world.

After reaching it, you are three kilometre into the race and a climb starts
towards Ter Kamerenbos (a.k.a. Bois de la Cambre a.k.a. La Cambre Forest")
ending in it at 7.5 km after which things flatten out somewhat. You leave this
park/forest around kilometre ten and now stick to one road for the next seven
kilometre.

This road features some net downhill, which is always welcome, and slowly
circles you back in the direction of the Parc du Cinquantenaire. At the
seventeen km mark you turn left onto the Tervurenlaan (a.k.a. Avenue de
Tervuren a.k.a. Tervuren Lane), a road many runners refer to with dread. Dread,
because soon after turning and over the course of about one kilometre, you are
handed forty metres of elevation. Painful if you are already at your limits. On
the plus side, once you are past it, you can see the finish which is only 1.5
km of straight road (with some roundabouts) away at that point. The finish is
under the Arcades du Cinquantenaire (a.k.a. Triomfboog van het Jubelpark a.k.a.
the Arch of the Jubileepark), ready to make you feel small just when you felt
good about yourself.

## Goals and Strategy

I had only one goal before the race: running the entire thing in 85 minutes (1h
25m).  I thought about listing other things here as well, "back up" goals, but
when thinking about it, I realise anything less would be a disappointment.

As such, the strategy was simple enough. Start out at 4:15/km pace for the
first ten kilometre. Check at the halfway point whether going faster is still
an option. Do not die.
