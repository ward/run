Just catching up on the past summer months with some highs and lows, PRs and
recurring little injuries, training a bit all over the place, but mostly in the
"not enough actual workouts" camp. I will just go through it chronologically.
There is one road race, one track relay (provincial) championship race, and two
individual track races.

## After the Brussels 20 km

I felt great after a [successful 20 km door Brussel][bxl20k] at the end of May.
Had two weeks of easy running, though not specifically low in volume after the
first week. Then halfway the third week, I got COVID19. So that made me skip
several days before carefully restarting. Maybe a week after restarting though,
I took a weird step when walking around the office and had a big stab of pain
in my left hip. I feel old writing that out. It is the same hip that bothered
me earlier in the year and I think it was the same injury coming back somehow.
I took another few days off before restarting more cautiously than I had after
the bout of COVID. I got back into the running routine over a week or two,
three, skipping a day because of travel. The running was kept easy, while I got
the volume back relatively quickly. By this point it was already July, it was
hot and humid, and I was in hillier terrain. The hip was likely fine already,
but I kept it as a sort of excuse to not have to run hard in terrible weather.
Fine or not, bad weather or not, I decided to hop in a local race to stretch
the legs and get some racing feel again.

Weeks overview:

- 87 km, post 20 km week [May-June]
- 113 km, no workouts
- 64 km, a workout, some strides, then got COVID and stopped
- 68 km, coming back from COVID
- 62 km, easy running, hip acts up [June-July]
- 69 km, easy running post hip niggle
- 85 km, easy running and a travel day
- 111 km, hot, humid, hilly, but easy beyond that

## Local Road Race with a Chance of First Place

The "CCRS Tuesday Ice Cream in the Park 5k series" caught my eye, largely
because there were not many other options in the area. The two previous races,
held at the end of May and the end of June, respectively, of the series had had
a winner that seemed easy enough to beat, though I wondered whether a college
athlete on their summer break might show up and smoke the field. TT or racing,
I was up for some action and signed up.

The race was on a Tuesday evening, 26 July, around 19:00, which helped a little
with the weather. You mostly did not have direct sunlight any more due to it
being low enough and the trees on the course helped block it too. It was still
warm, it was still humid. Before the start you got a ticket for the post race
raffle which I passed on to my wife just in case we were still there when that
occurred.

I went for a little jog, stretched a bit near what I supposed was the start
line, cheered a little at the kids' race, and observed other people getting
ready for our race, scoping out the competition. And then I spotted what looked
like a fast guy. Lean figure, wirey legs. I figured looks could be deceiving
though. Then he started another little jog to stay warm and the stride just
looked really smooth. He definitely looked faster than me. I figured I would
just try to follow him anyway though, see what happens. With the lack of fast
running due to COVID and the hip, I did not know what to expect, but I also did
not particularly mind blowing up. It is not like this race mattered, nor was I
going to PR here.

When the time came to line up, he and I were the only two to go stand at the
front. It was a small path, but a third or fourth person could have easily
joined in still. Nop, just us. Off we went, slightly trading places before I
quickly settled in behind him. I also quickly felt this was going to be a
tricky one to try and win. After 700-800 metre, my GPS said we were going 3:10
per km pace (~15:50 finish time). Translation: oops, that's a bit fast. Soon
after we hit a little bump for a bridge and my body decided to nop on the pace.
I got left behind.

For the next kilometre or so I was a bit out of it. I still tried to keep the
pace honest, but also needed a slight recovery. By around 2-2.5 km I heard
third place catch up to me. When he did, I decided to switch my focus to
finishing ahead of him. He had the same idea and we traded places several
times, sticking close together. He seemed to mostly try on the slight
"uphills", then I would throw it back at him in the "downhill" after it. I put
them in quotation marks since most of these were more anthill than anything,
though there was one uphill grassy section at 3.7 km where he might have almost
gotten me.

Eventually I managed to break him. Less than a kilometre from the finish, I did
my best to keep one of the surges for longer, maybe till the end. Suddenly I
did not hear him right behind me any more. I was quite sure I had a gap, but I
did not know how big the gap was. So I kept up the effort till the finish line
and got second place.

Result: a pretty meh 17:47, but even without the first km blow up, it would not
have been _much_ better. Just what the body could do on the day. First place
must have stopped pushing after dropping me because he ran 17:03 in the end. He
told me afterwards he had already done a workout that morning, so... ye. I
looked him up after and he is indeed a college runner. Third place came in 10
seconds behind me. He turned out to be the guy that won the May and June stages
of this series. I stuck around for the podium (there were gonna be some
coupons). Strangely enough they only "crowned" first male and female overall.
Instead they made me age category winner. :shrug: More hilariously, I won the
raffle and got a pair of free Mizuno shoes. I have been lucky with these
post-run raffles I feel like.

## Training and Travel

TODO Fill in this section with GoldenCheetah open.

- 95 km, race on Tuesday. Day off the day after because no time to run.
- 75 km, missed two days because too tired due to travel. [Aug]
- 113 km, LT workout.
- 107 km, missed a day due to travel. In the hot south of France climate.

## Track Racing: Exists

Clubboss contacted me that final week of August and asked whether I would be
interested in taking part in the 4×1500 relay race at the provincial
championships that Saturday. I figured it was time to jump back into real
racing and said sure. It ended up being a pretty small race. Only six teams
were fielded and half of those were mostly master runners. The other, faster
than me, guys of my club also were planning to make this more of a workout than
a race. I figured I would still try to run all out though.

I got placed as the first leg runner, which worked out nicely for me. I could
pace off of the other people. If you run any of the other legs, chances are you
are all alone. There were two guys that definitely could have gone faster, but
for some reason they both started around my pace. Fine by me. I just hung
behind them for as long as I could.

I tried to glance at my watch a few times and think I saw 1:10 for 400 metre
and 2:22 for 800. That is on pace for 4:23-4:25 and for 4:27-4:28,
respectively. About 1100 metre into the race, I could not hang on to the other
guys any more as they started speeding up and I started wilting away. Swapped
the baton in third position. I have no official time for my leg, that is not
measured, but my hand timing places me at [4:31][pkstrava]. Felt alright with
it for a first try.

The teammates managed to catch up to second place still, so in the end we went
home with a silver medal. (VICE-) PROVINCIAL CHAMPIONS, BABY!

Our total time ended up being [17:30.7][pkresults]. That averages to 4:22.x per
1500m.

- 113 km, with some light (TODO: confirm and add into paragraph) LT work and a
  race on Saturday.

## Race a 5000

Incensed by that track race, I went looking at what races were still left at
the tail end of the season. (TODO: confirm that I had not decided yet till
after the PK) I spotted a 5000m the following weekend that I figured I would
hop into, I still wanted to run under 16:30 at some point and figured I would
need a few more tries to get it right. It was also a planned down week that
week, so I figured maybe the lower volume would help a bit too. Thus that
Saturday I once again packed my spikes and went, coincidentally, to the same
track as the weekend before.

It was a day without wind, but the temperature was still 25C. Most of the race
was clouded though, so that helped. The first lap was too fast, as is
tradition. A guy in a green shirt took the lead and set a more steady pace for
our little group that had formed. I saw a faster group pull away in front of us
and was not sure whether I should follow them or not. I figured I would just
check it out. Overtook green shirt and tried to close the gap. After another
200 or 300m, I realised that that group was too fast for me. Indeed, they would
end up finishing in the low to mid 15s.

I ran alone for a little bit, ensuring I had not blown up too much from that
little attempt. The guys I had tried to leave behind caught back up to me and
we formed a group of four: me, green shirt, black shirt, and red-white shirt. I
let the others lead while I got my shit back together, hanging mostly in third
or fourth spot. Green took the lead, black took over for a while, then green
led some again. Eventually, redwhite shirt made a move to the front and I just
felt like I had to react. I followed him and settled into second.

Red-white led for a few laps and then I took over with four or five laps to go.
I figured he would appreciate some help. With three laps to go, I briefly tried
to push the pace some so we could finish strong (and maybe I could drop him). I
quickly realised it was a bit too early though. Red-white took over again with
about two laps left and he started pushing hard. I knew I had to hang on now or
I would slow way down after that mental loss. I stuck close for the penultimate
lap. With maybe 200-300 metre to go, he cracked me. I did not die, I just could
not follow him any more. I tried to just squeeze out everything I still had
left to the line.

After finishing, my watch said [16:29-16:30][5000strava]. I really hoped it
would be an under, not over. The results system was having some troubles, so I
could not quickly check my results online. Instead I had to wait till after my
cooldown to find out that I did it: [16:29.41][5000results]! Score. Red-white
beat me by a second. I do not know at what point we dropped the other guys from
our group, but they finished 8 and 30 seconds behind me.

Wife handtimed the laps, which I will just copy paste here. Will see if I can
be bothered to integrate that nicely into the previous text.

|Counter|Total Time|Lap Time|
|01|00:34.44|00:34.44|
|02|01:51.50|01:17.06|
|03|03:13.01|01:21.51|
|04|04:34.49|01:21.48|
|05|05:56.01|01:21.52|
|06|07:15.80|01:19.79|
|07|08:36.80|01:21.00|
|08|09:56.90|01:20.10|
|09|11:16.49|01:19.59|
|10|12:37.15|01:20.66|
|11|13:57.56|01:20.41|
|12|15:14.12|01:16.56|

That would actually indicate we did not speed up yet in the penultimate lap,
buuut it definitely felt like it at the time.

The day after I went to do a longish run and suddenly started feeling my left
hip again. Damnit. Not happy with how that keeps on coming back.
