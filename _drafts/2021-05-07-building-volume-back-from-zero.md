TODO: Add pictures from training log?

On Sunday 6 September 2020 I broke my left ankle. It led to a lot of rehab, as
a I described in my Broken Ankle Chronicles. Now, eight months later, I am back
around the volume I was running pre-break. In this post I will describe how I
went about that.

## First Steps

As described in more detail in the Broken Ankle Chronicles, I started running
again on 1 December 2020. I use the word "running" here with some poetic
license. It was mostly walking with some brief moments of attempting to run.
That first session had 3×3 minutes of running, at least 3 minutes of walking
between each running part. It was scary, it was rough. I got through it, I
needed more.

My PT wanted me to rest two days between each day of running. I was allowed to
slowly increase the running, but only allowed to do so every other run. By the
end of the month, I switched to running three times a week. On 31 December I ran
10 minutes, 3 minutes walk, 11 minutes, 3 minutes walk, and again 10 minutes.
Heading in the right direction, but still so so little compared to what I add
been used to before the break.

## The Plan

The week of 11 January was my last PT session. I sat around 30 km for that week
after following his increase every other run approach and still running three
times a week. As he kicked me out of the nest, I spread my wings and switched
into planning mode. I was in unfamiliar terrain and decided to use Jack
Daniels' rebuilding after injury plan. For someone who had been out as long as
I had, he says to run:

- 3 weeks at 30% of original volume, all easy
- 3 weeks at 50% of original volume, all easy
- 3 weeks at 70% of original volume, add in some strides
- 3 weeks at 85% of original volume, add in some Repetition work (say 200s and
  400s at ~1500-mile pace)
- 3 weeks at 100% of original volume, add in Threshold work

For original volume, I decided to pick 100 km per week. That makes those
percentages easy enough. 110 km may have been an option too, but I ran a little
less pre break due to some hip issue, so I settled on 100. The plan still
sounded aggressive, based on how I felt at the time, so I promised myself I
would keep an eye on the body and abandon following the plan to the letter to
give it the rest it might require.

## The 30%

As mentioned, the week of 11 January I already sat at around 30 km. I counted
that as the first week of the serious rebuilding. In the week of 18 January, I
moved away from the "just keep increasing distance every other run" idea. I
switched to a more conventional looking schedule, made it four days of running
per week, and also decided to slowly get rid of the walking breaks. That week I
still planned in minutes, which made the planning look like this.

- Mo: 3×10 minutes, 2 minutes walk break
- Tu: 10-15-10 minutes, 2 minutes walk break
- We: -
- Th: 3×10 minutes, 1 minute walk break
- Fr: -
- Sa: 3×15 minutes, 1 minute walk break
- Su: -

The third week at 30 km looked the same as above, but without the walking
breaks.

It should also be noted that ever since Novemberish, I had been doing the
elliptical rather vigorously. Just about an hour daily, a little bit less when
running, a little bit more on Sundays. This did not help me much in terms of
getting used to impact again, but it made a big difference in terms of being in
some sort of shape throughout this.

## The 50%

On 1 February I switched to 50 km per week. This jump up in volume was the
scariest to me. Going from 30 km to 50 km is a big increase when you look at it
in percentages. I figured at the time that if I made it through this one, the
rest of the increases would be easy. I had planned out the week to, ideally,
look as follows.

- Mo: -
- Tu: 10 km GA
- We: 7 km Recovery
- Th: 11 km GA
- Fr: -
- Sa: 7 km Recovery
- Su: 14 km GA

Where "GA" is just your every day run and "Recovery" is a little bit easier
still. In reality those Recoveries might have been pretty much GA too. My heart
rate was still skyrocketing easily on nearly every run so I ignored it and went
entirely by feel. The one thing you notice when running so little: your body
does not really need those Recovery runs to be slower because there is no
workout or long run that tired you out.

I do not think any of my weeks followed that planning exactly, shuffling days
around as it fit my planning, the weather, whatever. What was important was
just getting the distance in and that worked out fine.

In the second week, the medial side of my shins started acting up a little.
Just felt a bit off, a dull pain of sorts. I ran through it as it did not seem
bad enough. Throughout the third week, I still noticed it too often. I weaned
off some of the ellipticalling I had been doing still, hoping that giving all
the muscles some more rest would help take on the impact. I don't think that
changed much. I decided to do a fourth week at 50 km and, if it did not feel better by the end of that, jump back down in volume.

What I think eventually solved the issue, was one of the two pairs of shoes I
was using. It hit my arbitrary limit of 1000 km usage. I retired the pair and
within three days, the shins felt normal again. Oops. I am relatively sure that
was the culprit, but I was already some days into a fourth week at 50 km by
that point, so I stuck to the plan.

## The 70%

My next jump up in volume came the week of 1 March.
