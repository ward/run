A lot of training plans use seven day cycles. It is easier to plan around given
just about everyone has a consistent seven days to work with.  It is, however,
trickier for recovery. Most plans cram three workouts in those seven days. If
you want recovery days of easier running in-between those three, then you might
try something like: `rrwrwrw` for a week. For two of the workouts, you will
have but one day of recovery until the next workout. Depending on your body,
that can be not ideal.

With that in mind, many have suggested moving away from seven day cycles and
replacing them with nine or ten day cycles.  In this manner you can place two
recovery days between each workout. A disadvantage is that you lose the
consistency in your life.  No more Tuesday track workout, Sunday long run, ...
or whichever ones you are used to. Important days are bound to shift place week
to week. Regardless, I was interested in the idea of forcing enough recovery
days.  I thought some more about it and decided to jot down my ideas.

# Scheduling

Being able to schedule everything is an important part of getting a plan to
work. Have a look at this (rather dense) view of how seven, nine, and ten day
cycles link up with a regular week. The `r`s are recovery days, the `w`s
workout days. The capitalised `W` means the end of a cycle.

[As expected][lcd], from the point of view of a regular week, it takes nine
(resp. ten) weeks for the nine (resp. ten) day cycle to start over again.
Tricky for planning. A suggestion I have read to get around this issue is to
alternate a ten and eleven day cycle.  This way you "start over" every three
weeks. Another idea I had was to just use a bunch of three day cycles and see
how you can make it work.
