One of my goals for 2016 was to drop below 40 minutes on the 10 km. I gave it a
shot in August without any specific training. It was flat, it was hot. [I
failed to go sub 40, but set a PR at 41:35][belgchamp]. With the year running
on its end, I had decided on a late November race to have a proper go at this,
with proper training. The field of battle: the first event of the
[Natuurloopcriterium Lier][natuurloop] on 26 November.

## Training

As a plan I started from Pete Pfitzinger's lowest 10 km plan, adding some more
distance to fit with where I was at the start of the plan. I lowered the
relative peaking in terms of distance (relative to the first few weeks).
VO2max and speed workouts I kept the same. VO2max workouts consisted mostly of
repetitions of 1000 metre at 3-5k race pace. Speed workouts were repetitions of
about 200 metre at 800 metre to 1 mile race pace. For tempos I made a slight
adjustment in terms of the progression, but nothing major. All the tempos were
LT intervals. I also extended the plan a bit at the front as I had 15 weeks
till the start of the race rather than 12 weeks. So far for the theory.

Alas, in practice it was not quite so. On the first speed workout, during the
13th week before race week, I got injured.  I was doing the speed workout on
the road and one of the intervals happened to be on an uphill. My left hip felt
a bit odd when suddenly it felt like a tendon or muscle shifted over the bone
on the side. Things hurt, I immediately abandoned the workout. I still had to
run about six kilometre home though.  Two days later I thought it had rested
enough (this was not the case) and ran an endurance run. After that I finally
wizened up and took a week off.

After the week of rest, I could run again. The pain was gone, but the hip
remained uncomfortable. This kept me on my toes for a while: at the least sign
of weakness from my hip, I gave up on workouts. The real fast parts (speed and
strides) I pretty much avoided altogether. My distance remained mostly what I
had planned out.  I broke my weekly distance record twice in a row right before
the first tune up race.

This [first tune up race][canalrun] was the fifth week before race week. It
went well, I ran 4 km in 14:21. However, I think I might have done it slightly
too fast. Since this is a race you mostly "train through", your plan does not
wait for you to recover, you have to be ready for the next run immediately. It
seems I might not have been ready and for two weeks I struggled with a very
tight right calf, borderline painful at times. This did not stop me in the
fourth week before race week, I broke my weekly distance record again, setting
it at 73.9 km. The week after, i.e., the third week before race week, I did
take things easier than planned: slightly less distance, no workouts.

The short taper for the [second tune up race][vrede] finally fixed the right
calf.  I ended up racing that race more conservatively simply due wanting not
to blow up during the race, but I guess I could have claimed I did not want to
be unable to recover. I ran those 4 km in 15:10. After that race, disaster
struck.

I got sick. Fever, coughing, phlegm, snot, throat in ruins, and in need of
hours and hours of extra sleep. Running was out of the question and I was less
than 14 days away from race day. Seven days out I gave running a try, thinking
I was feeling better, but my body was not quite there yet. I needed more days
off and race day was fast approaching. In the end, I gambled on hoping my
training had been enough and that my body would be there when it needed to be.
I did not run at all till Friday, the day before the race. On Friday I ran 5 km
at recovery pace with some strides sprinkled in. My heart rate was higher than
I wanted, but running did not feel impossible.  I decided I would indeed take
part.

## Course Details

It is a flat course! That is the main reason I picked this one out. It runs
along the rivers in Lier, so except for some short bumps for bridges, there is
no elevation to be found. Those bumps suck the pace out of you, but at least
they are quickly over with. Running along the river also makes the course
pretty uneventful, but that is OK, I am not here for the scenery.

The start is near the track where the finish is. After 1.6 km you come at a
bridge you have to cross to run back on the other side.  In other words two
short right angle turns in quick succession. I will refer to this as a bridge
turn, there are some more further down the line. At about 2.2 km, there is a
turn slightly larger than a right angle.  Next you are good for a while, turn
left under a bridge around 3.8 km and then right immediately to continue in the
same direction as before the bridge.  Around 4.7 km there is another turn
larger than a right angle. At 6.7 km you have another bridge turn. About 1 km
from the end, a last bridge turn has to be completed. Once you reach the track
where the finish lies, you have to completely one lap to be home free.

The bridge turns were pretty nasty. On the bridge itself you could only go on
the sidewalk, so you had to turn very sharply. This takes your pace away
completely.  Throughout the race, these and the random short bumps really hurt
me.

## Goals and Strategy

I signed up for this race with only one goal: going sub 40. Despite the
sickness, I decided to stick to that. Just go for the pace and either make it
or crash and burn. Right before the race, I was ready to give myself a slight
concession and also be happy with a PR (i.e., faster than 41:35). The strategy
remained the same though: aim for sub 40.

## Race Day

Nothing too eventful here, though the girlfriend decided to DNS. At first she
had planned to do the 10 miles race. Due to her lingering sickness (she caught
the same thing I had, with some delay, but not as strongly affected), she
shortened it to the 10 km race, then the 5 km race, and eventually deciding it
was safer not to push the body just yet. I remained convinced I should give it
a try, so we took the train to Lier. This took 1h30 to 2h and was one of those
few moments where I wish I had a driver's license and car. Oh well.

I went to line up for the start on a little road of maybe a car wide. Going by
previous results, I figured my goal time would place me around 30th. So I
dutifully lined up several rows back from the front. People were still quite
spread out, but I did not give that any thought until the announcer pointed out
the entire grassy field to my right would also be part of the start line.  This
approach placed me much further back in the crowd than I had wanted. A few rows
back when rows are 6ish people wide is different from rows of 30+ people.
Worse, while the startline was now very wide, the path narrowed about 200 metre
further to the car-wide road I was on. This reminded me of descriptions of
cross country race starts. I decided I would go fast enough at the start to not
be in a potential bottleneck. Especially when I heard some guy in front of me
say "yea, I am aiming for 45 minutes, if I do not end up walking of course".

## Race

Once the race started, I managed to quickly move up through the crowd. Once
past the potential bottleneck area, I was behind a small group but immediately
felt they would be going too fast for me. When a guy next to me expressed that
same feeling out loud ("phew, this is going a bit too fast"), I checked my
watch and realised he was right.  We were going 3:30 <!-- TODO CHECK THIS PACE,
INSERT TINA PICTURE? -->. I asked him what he was aiming for. He wanted a 3:45
pace. I said that would definitely be more than I could handle today and 100
metre further I purposefully slowed down a lot, letting a group of 10-15 people
pass me.

I find my own pace, but after the first km auto lap I realise I am going
slightly too slow. Maybe I should autolap more often during a race where I want
to PR. I adjust my pace accordingly. By this time, some people have been right
behind me. I guess I will be playing pacer for them today. I do not mind, I
have my own time goal and dare not rely on their pacing to get me there anyway.
I do not try to force them to take the lead in our little group. I do not even
bother looking back, so I am unsure how many there are behind me at this point,
maybe a picture will pop up. Only two I am sure of:

1. an older guy with some grey streaks in his hair (he comes next to me a few
   times in the first km) and
2. someone behind who yells out things coming from the opposite direction. The
   path we run on is not blocked off for the race, so there are still some
   cyclists and walkers around. It seems like a little thing, but I really
   appreciate him doing that while I half zone out half die over the next kms.

I am slowly reeling in some kid as we approach the first bridge turn. Not
wanting him in my way when I turn, I make sure to speed up slightly so I can
catch him before the turn.  The turn momentarily saps all pace out of me, but
as we are only about 1.6 km into the race, I quickly recover and get back into
the groove.

I continue leading my group, though often when looking at my watch I feel it is
going slightly too slow and speed up some. Just before the 4 km mark, we go
under a bridge to go to the other side of some railroad track. The guy standing
at the end of the bridge does a poor job indicating the way and if there were
no guys ahead of me, I would have taken a wrong turn here. I do not think I
lose any time, but it does annoy me briefly.

We pass a sign indicating the 5 km mark, but my watch strongly disagrees: 4.65
km in 18:35. That time would indeed be too fast for 5 km.

Around 6 km a left turn is coming up. As I follow the path towards it, I notice
the people behind me just going left through the grassy patch. Apparently
everyone has been doing that, so I also take my turn. Suddenly I find myself at
the back of my group. Now I can also see what is left of my group: two guys,
one of which the older guy. No clue if the other guy is the one who was
shouting warnings. I do not think it a good idea to try to immediately pass
them again to resume my pacing, so I decide to follow.

This quickly bites me in the ass: they slowly pull away from me. I do not know
if they speed up or if I slow down, but it is a rather demoralizing moment. I
come back to them briefly, but fade away again immediately. Soon after two
other guys pass me and I briefly wonder if they were perhaps part of my little
group before. I am struggling as they start pulling away, but quickly decide I
need to hold on and use their pacing or completely fade away. I latch on and
zone out focusing on their steps.

Find my own pace around 4:00 and realise there are some people trailing me.
Do not care, let them follow, I got my own goal and do not dare rely on their pacing.
Keep this up for a while, trying to keep the pace where it should be.
It hurts and my willpower is strained.
Around 6 km coming out of a right turn, the path goes straight for a bit before turning to the left.
I follow the straight, my peeps immediately go left through the grass.
Notice it, turn to follow them, suddenly trailing them. Quickly have trouble following them and let them go for a bit.
Catch back up, give up again. They pass yellow fluo guy.
Around 7(?) km, I pass yellow fluo guy that was in my view entire race is finally passed. Look for him in photos after me?
Two guys come from behind me. I am struggling and let them pass me.
Quickly decide I need to hold on or I will die.
Latch on and trust their pacing.
Oldish guy that trailed me forever remains slightly ahead of us.

Hun 5k bord was 4.65 voor mij. 18:36 daar.  Groepje geleid voor eerste 6km.
Kerel met donker haar met grijze tinten constant in m'n nek. Een bocht bij 6k
pakte ik stukken groter dus groepje (2 over) ging me voorbij. Ik dacht hun te
laten pacen maar kon niet meer mee. Ander groepje van twee passeerde me later.
Hun ook eerst kwijt, dan weer bijgekomen. Hun begonnen volgen. 1 van de twee
ging ervandoor op 1km van het eind. De andere stak ik voorbij bij bet opgaan
van de piste. In laatste bocht voor de piste haalde ikook grijzede kerel in.
Hij zei "zolang ik maar onder 40min geraak!".
