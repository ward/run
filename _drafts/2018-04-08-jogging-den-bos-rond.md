On Monday I decided I really felt like racing something longer than the 10 km
races I have been doing recently.  I want to do the 20 km door Brussel at the
end of May and I feel like I need a bit more of an idea of what to expect.  It
has been two years since I raced anything over 10 km. My eye fell on the
"Jogging Den Bos Rond" which offered a 5.7 km, a 11.2 km, and a 16.7 km by
doing one, two, or three loops, respectively. I decided to do the 16.7 km one.

## Training

In February I had some consistent weeks in a row. About 65 km per week with an
LT workout, a long run, and some speedwork in it ("R" in Jack Daniels'
terminology). The rest of the day are filled up with easy runs and Mondays are
a day off. In March I came down with a fever and less than ideal breathing,
though I managed to mostly contain it to just one week in terms of runs
skipped. However, it did interfere with the actual workouts. Between getting
sick and this race, I did no real workouts any more.

The weeks leading up to the race, I did the following distances: 30.1 (fever
week), 62.6, 65.6, and 66.4 (race week, including the race).  I purposefully
put the race at the end of three high weeks. I usually take an easier week
every fourth week so figured I would combine it with recovery from the race.

## Course Details

There is about 100 metre of asphalt that takes you from/to to the start/finish.
The rest is just doing the loop one, two, or three times. Most of the course is
pretty much flat. Not enough to affect your pace more than a few seconds.

The loop starts with a few 100 metre of asphalt.

## Goals and Strategy

I am doing the 20km door Brussel race at the end of May. Two years ago I blew
up. Last year I did not take part due to being abroad at the time of the race.
This year I want to do better. The goal during this race was just to keep my
heart rate under control, not to go over LT training heart rate. In my case:
low 170s. This way I could see where that would bring me and what I could
expect from the goal race.

## Race Day

Woke up around 7:00, had a quick bite of spaghetti leftovers from the night
before. Drank all the water I needed to. Left around 7:50 to walk to the train
station to take the train. Got to the village around 8:35. Walked to the sign
up location, the girlfriend and I were the first two to sign up for the 16.7km
and got the bibs 1001 and 1002 for our efforts ("hurrah"). We were rather early
due to train scheduling, so we waited around a bit chilling. Eventually
changed, dropped the bag in the dressing room, and did a warm-up to keep up
appearances (maybe 500-1000 metre tops). Did not feel like I really needed it
for a race this length. Jogged to the finish line and placed myself a few lines
down from the front to be ready for the race start at 10:00. A few lines down
because the 5.7 and the 11.2km started at the same time, so there would be
plenty of people ready to run faster than I had in mind.

## Race

*Make this into a text.*

- A bit too fast at the start, but noticed it soon and fixed it.
- Not really finding a group that was going my pace, slowly passing people
  throughout the first lap.
- Often hang behind someone, then slowly overtake and drop them.
- Water stand halfway the lap, each round I just grab it to throw water over
  myself.
- Around start(?) of the train track (4k in), catch up to a woman and hang
  behind her for a while. Works out-ish pacewise.
- About 5k in one of the sign people yells at the woman "you're the second
  woman". Reminds me that she's probably doing the 5.7k so I will be losing my
  pacer. There were some other people around too though, so I figured we'd have
  our little group for the next lap at least.
- End of that first lap, everyone around me turns away. `<_<`
- In the distance I see two guys, figure I can slowly get closer briefly and
  then hang with them maybe.
- Not really closing in, afraid of going too hard.
- 6km in yellow shirt blasts past me, puts me on 100-200 metre and then hangs
  there for the rest of the race
- The two guys pass someone else who hangs with them for a bit.
- The guy they passed + one of them start fading away.
- I pass them
- Leftover red shirt is still ahead
- About to catch him near the end of lap 2, but he just turned away to finish.
- Heard shouts of a "come on dad" behind me, notice that guy _does_ turn with
  me to do a third lap. Yellow shirt still hanging in the distance.
- Shortly into the last lap, with 5km to go, I decided to go a little bit
  harder. Heart rate had been high 160s, now moving it to low 170s.
- Uneventful for the first half. Yellow shirt stays ahead. In turns I see the
  other guy is hanging 5-10 metre behind me.
- Around halfway I start passing people. It's people doing two loops. Most of
  them notice me in time and make way if needed.
- Further I get, the more of them I start passing.
- Notice yellow shirt wont fade away.
- Decide to make sure I won't be passed by the guy behind me, not sure how
  close or far behind me he is. HR creeps a bit closer to 175.
- 200-300 metre from the finish, I again hear the "come on dad" shouts which
  tells me he is too close to gamble.
- I start a little sprint with whatever I had left
- PLACE THE PHOTO HERE
- He does not pass me

## Results

I finished 10th out of 54 participants. Official time of 70:34. Strava has two
seconds fewer since I was a few rows down (it was not chip time). The dad
behind me arrived four seconds behind me. He thanked me for the pacing, said it
looked smooth. That was nice to hear. Yellow shirt finished 10 seconds ahead of
me. The winner did it in 58:31, quite a bit ahead of me, though there is a big
drop off after him and the second place guy (59:22): third place was in 65:15.

Only seven women took part in the 16.7 km and none of them especially
competitively so: 79:10, 79:21, and 82:15. Coincidentally, that third spot was
the girlfriend, who was taking this race as just a slightly faster long run.
Neither of us really expected it, but it made us stay around to allow her to
enjoy getting a trophy and a small cash prize.

## Future

The main goal for this spring has become the 20km door Brussel on 27 May. I
have not been doing much specific training and I do not think that will change.
I will however try to do some tempos more consistently and try a few
progression long runs. At least one of those I will combine with the 10km de
l'ULB race on 22 April. Besides that, I might do the Woluwe-St-Lambert 15km
which is two weeks before the 20km. How exactly I would race that one though, I
do not know yet.
