The Rotterdam marathon. My first go at racing a marathon.

## Overly Long Dramatic Intro

For as long as I have been running, people have asked me about whether I had
done or was training for a marathon. The thought never appealed to me. One
reason might be just to be contrarian. If everyone sees something as the thing
to go for, it manages to subconsciously lose its appeal to me. One reason might
be because of what a dumb distance it is. My running career was nurtured on
(albeit, badly Belgian measured) 5 kms, 10 kms, and 20 kms. Nice round numbers.
The marathon? Something with wanting to finish in front of the palace of some
now dead monarch, if memory serves. I think the major reason was though, that I
realised I liked trying to run fast. I saw the marathon as something people
moved up to to avoid having to go through the training to get faster. "Why run
harder when you can slow down for longer?"

Fast is relative of course. Fast is everyone that beats me in races. I remain
average. For a while I held off the boat with the excuse "I will think about
the marathon when I get faster and think I can run sub 3:00". That point came
and went as I improved on other distances, but my desire to run a marathon did
not develop. On the contrary, I had discovered track racing in earnest and
liked what I saw.

And yet. Over the past eight months, the idea of racing a marathon started
growing in my mind. I do not know if it is really true, but I like to say the
seed was planted when a colleague told me he was the best marathoner at the
office. He said it as sort of a joke, but he was right: of all those that had
run a marathon, he was the fastest. He added "and please don't run one". I can
get a bit competitive about things. Either way, I started thinking about
marathons. I also thought that while I do not care about the distance now, I
might start caring in a few years. By that time, some experience could come in
handy. With most people only racing a marathon 2-3 times a year, building that
experience would take time. Another point in favour of the marathon.

Back in, I want to say, November, I looked around a bit at the options for
spring marathons. Gent caught my eye because of its proximity. Going by
conversion from shorter distances, I might have also been able to run a top 20
(twenty) there. That always looks nice. Rotterdam also caught my eye. It is the
Netherlands, so it is flat. I had heard it was well organised. I saw the
results from previous years and I was going to have to work to be top 200 (two
hundred). That meant there would be a lot of people to run with in case the
going got hard. That has really dragged me through some bad spells in races in
the past, so if I had to make a choice, Rotterdam would be it. And then I
shelved the idea and sort of forgot about it.

Around the end of January, beginning of February, I thought about the marathon
again. I opened the Rotterdam marathon website. It had already sold out and...
I felt a pang of FOMO. That was the very moment that I realised I did want to
run Rotterdam. Bit late, innit?

Rotterdam marathon also has a "Vraag en Aanbod forum". Basically people with a
ticket that do not want to use it any more, e.g., because of injury, can offer
their ticket up for sale. Potential buyers then fill in their email address and
hope the seller picks them to talk to. As I write this, I do not know whether
they actually offered this in a language other than Dutch. Maybe not, to avoid
scams. From time to time I opened the forum and filled in my email address in a
bunch of offers. Weeks passed without a reply, but I figured even a sale three
weeks out from the marathon would be fine. I already had my training that kept
me busy, all that I would need to adjust was some taper time the final weeks
before the actual race.

Eventually someone contacted me and somewhere in early March, I was officially
signed up for the Rotterdam marathon.
