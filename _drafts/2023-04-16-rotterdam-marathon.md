The Rotterdam marathon. My first go at racing a marathon.

## Overly Long Dramatic Intro

For as long as I have been running, people have asked me about whether I had
done or was training for a marathon. The thought never appealed to me. One
reason might be just to be contrarian. If everyone sees something as the thing
to go for, it manages to subconsciously lose its appeal to me. One reason might
be because of what a dumb distance it is. My running career was nurtured on
(albeit, badly Belgian measured) 5 kms, 10 kms, and 20 kms. Nice round numbers.
The marathon? Something with wanting to finish in front of the palace of some
now dead monarch, if memory serves. I think the major reason was though, that I
realised I liked trying to run fast. I saw the marathon as something people
moved up to to avoid having to go through the training to get faster. "Why run
harder when you can slow down for longer?"

Fast is relative of course. Fast is everyone that beats me in races. I remain
average. For a while I held off the boat with the excuse "I will think about
the marathon when I get faster and think I can run sub 3:00". That point came
and went as I improved on other distances, but my desire to run a marathon did
not develop. On the contrary, I had discovered track racing in earnest and
liked what I saw.

And yet. Over the past eight months, the idea of racing a marathon started
growing in my mind. I do not know if it is really true, but I like to say the
seed was planted when a colleague told me he was the best marathoner at the
office. He said it as sort of a joke, but he was right: of all those that had
run a marathon, he was the fastest. He added "and please don't run one". I can
get a bit competitive about things. Either way, I started thinking about
marathons. I also thought that while I do not care about the distance now, I
might start caring in a few years. By that time, some experience could come in
handy. With most people only racing a marathon 2-3 times a year, building that
experience would take time. Another point in favour of the marathon.

Back in, I want to say, November, I looked around a bit at the options for
spring marathons. Gent caught my eye because of its proximity. Going by
conversion from shorter distances, I might have also been able to run a top 20
(twenty) there. That always looks nice. Rotterdam also caught my eye. It is the
Netherlands, so it is flat. I had heard it was well organised. I saw the
results from previous years and I was going to have to work to be top 200 (two
hundred). That meant there would be a lot of people to run with in case the
going got hard. That has really dragged me through some bad spells in races in
the past, so if I had to make a choice, Rotterdam would be it. And then I
shelved the idea and sort of forgot about it.

Around the end of January, beginning of February, I thought about the marathon
again. I opened the Rotterdam marathon website. It had already sold out and...
I felt a pang of FOMO. That was the very moment that I realised I did want to
run Rotterdam. Bit late, innit?

Rotterdam marathon also has a "Vraag en Aanbod forum". Basically people with a
ticket that do not want to use it any more, e.g., because of injury, can offer
their ticket up for sale. Potential buyers then fill in their email address and
hope the seller picks them to talk to. As I write this, I do not know whether
they actually offered this in a language other than Dutch. Maybe not, to avoid
scams. From time to time I opened the forum and filled in my email address in a
bunch of offers. Weeks passed without a reply, but I figured even a sale three
weeks out from the marathon would be fine. I already had my training that kept
me busy, all that I would need to adjust was some taper time the final weeks
before the actual race.

Eventually someone contacted me and somewhere in early March, I was officially
signed up for the Rotterdam marathon.

## Training

I will only give a detailed overview of what happened since the [Belgian Half
Marathon Championships][bkhalf] 35 days (5 weeks) prior to this race. For more
details, check out that report. Basically during winter I had built up to 120
km per week and kept that steady, not really doing workouts. Six weeks prior to
that race (so 11 weeks prior to this marathon), I reintroduced workouts. LT
work and some Marathon pace attempts.

After the race, the plan was to do a recovery week, then two up weeks around
120 km with workouts. Finally two taper weeks with the race at the last Sunday.
I will count the weeks down to one in this overview.

_Week 6_. Week of the half marathon race. Some lower volume as a mini taper for
the race. Race pace workout on Tuesday. Race on Sunday. Good effort, new PR,
yadeyade, see [the other report][bkhalf].

_Week 5_. Planned post race recovery week. 10-13-13-13-13 for the weekdays.
Lower side of the belly felt sore from the race effort. Legs more sore than
they had been in a while. Nothing worrying, just racing shenanigans. The night
of Friday to Saturday, things went to shit. Literally. I had a stomach bug,
flu, whatever you want to call it, and everything had to go. I forced some
puking to hopefully resolve the situation, but kept on feeling bad. Saturday I
quickly decided to not go for my planned long run. [Fool me
once][20kbxl-sickly], don't get fooled again, and all that. The non-literal
runs continued, I had zero appetite, and whatever I did manage to eat seemed to
go straight through. I thought I'd suffer for a day, but no, it continued for
days on end. I lost Sunday too. Just 64 km for the week.

_Week 4_. I continued being sick and lost another three days of running. Five
days down the shitter. I lost 4 kg in the process and I do not have many to
lose. When I finally seemed past it, I dared to try running again. My body had
taken a beating though, everything felt like a lot of effort, I still needed to
regain all the energy I had lost barely eating for days. Rest of the week was
6, 10, 13, and 13 km. 42 km total. I did also manage a 17 km walk on Saturday.
Running too much too soon felt risky, but I figured a walk was more readily kept
easy or abandoned.

_Week 3_. I needed a good week still before the race and this one had to
suffice. I ran 120 km for the week, but did not feel quite right enough to do a
workout yet. Long run (30k) and mid-week long run (23k) went fine though. Also
made sure to have another go at practising taking in gels. That seemed fine
too, no stomach issues. For the 30 km I took five of them. First one at 2 km,
then another one every 4 km. 88 kcal per gel, 22 gram carbs.

_Week 2_. And then it was already taper time. It felt weird after just the one
up week because of the illness, but I felt more like playing this one safe.
Whether it was the right choice, I will never know. I put the plan for this
together rather belatedly, getting inspiration from Pfitzinger's "18/85" plan
(18 week plan, peaking at 137 km or 85 miles). I settled on 90 km for the first
taper week: 14, 10, 15, 10, 11, 21, and 9 km. Strides on Monday and Friday. A
CV workout on Wednesday. If I had not been sick and actually done workouts the
two weeks prior, I would have done VO2max then, and probably now too. In the
current situation, I decided to not try my first VO2max in a while just 10 days
before the marathon. I did 4Ã—1000 aiming for about 3:21 to 3:26. Actual splits:
3:27, 3:23, 3:19, and 3:21. Had actually wanted to do five reps, but something
felt a bit off on the fourth one, so I called it a day. Rest was about 1:10
(~1/3rd of the time of a rep).

_Week 1, race week_. Not much running left at this point: 11, 10, 13, 10, 8, 6,
race day. Total prior to race day: 58 km. Wednesday I did 3 km at marathon
pace, but the GPS went all wonky and I was constantly speeding up and slowing
back down to get the pacing right. Maybe I should have done it on a track just
to be sure the one time. Considerations for another time. Either way, paces
were a bit all over the place, but it did not worry me. Strides on Monday and
Friday.

## Goal and Strategy

### Pace

Back when I first considered running this marathon, my then half marathon PR
put me just shy of 2:40. My PRs on the shorter distances put me under 2:40.
That looked pretty, but also probably just out reach. Then in March I ran
1:14:52 on the half marathon, which translates to a 2:36:35. All calculations
in this paragraph based on JD's vdot calculator.

So. Ye. That's really tempting. At first I was hesitant to go out that
aggressively on my first marathon. Surely it was safer to go out at 2:45? Play
it safe, don't blow up, keep the fast work for a future marathon. Alas, the
more I thought about it, the more I realised I wanted that sub 2:40. 2:40:xx or
2:41? Maybe I could live with it, but I probably would not be _happy_. Slower
still? I think I would just be disappointed. I am not trying to qualify for
anything, I am not trying to beat anyone. It's intrinsic motivation only and
that one was now all in on sub 2:40.

So that is the **goal time: 2:39:59. That is 3:47.5 per km**. Even splits
seemed the safest approach, so the plan was to aim for that pace from the
start. Banking time sounds risky, even with the hypothetical few seconds per km
I supposedly could go faster according to the calculator. Starting too slow
sounds risky too, cause that expects me to be able to speed up in the second
half. I didn't know yet whether I would dare to speed up if I did happen to
feel good later on in the race. Either way, that was a decision that I wouldn't
need to make till maybe 34 km into the race. Worries for
beat-up-by-the-marathon-me. We cross a bridge twice and go through a tunnel,
but besides that I don't think there is any elevation. So not much to plan for
on that end.

Spurned on by the wonky GPS during the last marathon pace mini workout the week
of the race, I also checked heart rate ranges in Pfitzinger's Advanced
Marathoning book. I got 155-166. Had no clue what in that range to aim for, but
I was going to remember that range.

### Nutrition

I had a bunch of the gels I tried three weeks out (88kcal, 22g carbs). They
would have to do. I wanted to take in six of them and ended up packing a
seventh as backup. The plan was to take one at 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 km. It
seemed to work in training. There are water stands every five km, so be sure to
take some sips of water every time.

### The Others

I like the racing aspect of, well, racing. In a 5000m you can gamble to try and
follow somebody's move even if it feels a little bit hot. Probably a bit
riskier to do that in your first marathon. I picked Rotterdam cause there
should be a good number of people around my pace. I just have to make sure they
do not lure me into running too fast. Definitely run my own race the first
20-30 km, then evaluate after. But damn, it may be difficult to rein myself in.
I will have to tell myself this a few times in the corral and during the first
few kilometre.

## Pre-Race

### The Week

I found myself not thinking about the marathon as much as I would have expected
going by other people's accounts. None of the "taper crazies" or anything like
it. Maybe cause it still feels like something extra, not a main goal I have
worked towards over months. It is running, how much worse can it be than the
suffering I always put myself through? I planned out my logistics of course,
but never sat around fretting. By this point I had settled on my goal pace as
well, so there was nothing that could be done any more.

### The Weekend

My wife and I made our way to Rotterdam on Saturday. It is an easy train ride
from Brussels. Arriving around 13:00, I had eaten on the train, food I had
brought from home. We went to the marathon expo to get my bib and a free
running t-shirt. Walk through all the stands that I did not feel like standing
around for. Got to rest them legs! We bought what we needed to make some pasta
in the evening and made our way to the place we were staying. Rest of the
afternoon and evening was spent sitting around and planning the final details
of the morning of. The place I had gotten last minute was in a bit of a dead
zone public transport wise and I did not want to have to walk too much in the
morning. We settled on getting a ride in the morning to the nearest metro
station and taking that into the city. Next time: think better about public
transport options when getting your place.

### The Day

I put my alarm at 6:00, four hours before the race was supposed to start. I
mostly wanted to give my body enough of a buffer to do all the toilet business
it might need to. Had 150g of muesli I had brought along from home and 300ml
soy milk with it. Drank two cups of Kenyan black tea. Feeling faster already.
Went to the toilet a few times, took a shower. We planned to get out the door
at 8:00. In case getting a ride failed, there would still be enough time to
walk to the public transport. The ride showed up soon and brought us to the
metro station nearby (driving into the city wasâ€¦ difficult because of the
marathon).

Because of the walking backup buffer, we got to the center of
Rotterdam a bit earlier than originally planned. We went to the marathon expo
building again to sit inside where it was dry and warm (it was about 7-8C and
had started to drizzle a little). I went to the toilet there again and we sat
around for a while waiting for the start to draw closer.

Around 9:10 we started meandering towards my wave. Since I was more near the
front, we still had to walk down all the waves. There was a large amount of
portapotties everywhere. Both outside and inside the waves by the looks of it.
I tried using one just in case. Getting bellycramps during a race is something
I always worry about. The checks to get in your wave were quite diligent. Would
not have been able to just hop in there. I jogged around for like half a km as
warmup, gave my wife the last of my extra gear, and went into 1.C, my start
area. I was not sure where in this area to start. I think it was everyone from
2:31 to 2:59, so I wiggled between a bit to move up some lines, then stood
around waiting for the gun.

They had a guy with a red flag at an elevated platform at the front. This
indicated it was still more than two minutes. Dutch singer Lee Towers sang
"You'll Never Walk Alone", which is apparently a tradition at the start of this
race. At some point the red flag got swapped out for a green flag, indicating
the final two minutes.

The gun went off aaaand we walked towards the start line. Always a little
anticlimactic that way. Eventually I reached the actual start line.

## Race

Almost immediately after starting, you have to cross the Erasmusbrug. A podcast
I listen to had expressly said to not go out too fast on that. I had kept that
advice in mind. It was also quite crowded at this point, so I could not
actually go much faster up it than I was doing there. I think I kept things
under control, but it is hard to know for sure. There are also a lot of
spectators right there on both sides on the bridge. The tram line that normally
goes through the middle is also rerouted and taken over by spectators. A wall
of cheers to go through. You quickly reach the top of this bridge and when
heading down I pass some more people. Going downhill is easier for me.

Over the next several km I am mostly trying to find my pace. I do not trust the
1 km splits too much and instead pay extra attention to my heart rate. That one
quickly settles around 159-160, smack dab in the middle of the range I planned
for. I decide then and there to aim for that heart rate for a while, ignoring
pace till I hit the 5 km marker. I had written down the 5, 10, and 40 km splits
on my hand as well, so that was easier to compare than doing the mental math
with 3:47.5 per km. My plan to take a gel at 2 km felt silly since nobody else
was grabbing anything yet, but at 3.x I decided to grab my first one after all.
Perhaps a little too early. Around the 5 km point is also a water stand and I
grab a cub and try to drink some of it. I am sure most of it splashes out, but
at least some of it I managed to actually drink.

Similarly continued on the next 5 km. I had another gel around 7.x km and felt
the belly be a little unhappy a km or so later, so I decided to put some more
kms between gels. Another water attempt at 10 km.

{% include racesplit.html content='
5 km: 18:53, 10 km: 37:50. 4-5 seconds ahead of schedule for both.
' %}

I think by this point I was in a bit of a group with similarly paced people. I
ran at the front for a bit, I purposefully moved a bit further back at some
point because there was a head wind. I kept an eye on my heart rate and was
also satisfied with the pacing so far. I did try to keep an eye on the km
splits too, had to ensure I kept on sub 2:40 pace. We all ran together for a
good while. Some people in the group had friends, coaches, whatever, that would
be ready with bottles or gels, some biking between spots, some briefly biking
along to hand over what was needed. A squeezy bottle did seem a lot easier to
drink from than the paper cups we got from the organisation. I just carried my
own gels and had another one of those around 13-14 km. I think I aimed it for
the next water stand. Help digesting with some fluids. After the 15 km water
stand I suddenly found myself a bit ahead of my group. I don't know whether I
subconsciously speed up through them or whether everyone else slows way down.
Briefly thought about waiting for them specifically again, but decided to just
hang at the pace I was hitting. The next five are a bit of a blur, but I
remember getting some more headwind. I had gel number four at some point. My
mental math with the splits was failing me, so I was just waiting for the
halfway mark to have a better idea. 2:40 divided by 2 I could still handle.

Somewhere in this block I was also thinking how kinda boring it was. You are
racing, but it is mostly a game of ensuring you do not push too hard. OK, every
race is like that, but in a marathon it actually has to feel somewhat easy for
quite a while. In a 5k it is more about only slightly killing yourself the
first half.

{% include racesplit.html content='
15 km: 56:52, 20 km: 1:15:47, half marathon: 1:19:58.
1s, 3s, and 2s ahead of schedule.

## Results

## Lessons Learned

- Doing the final marathon pace test in the race week might be nicer on a
  track, just to have the exact pacing.
- The place we were staying at was not ideal for public transport. A 25 minute
  walk through nature to get to the public transport was nice in normal
  circumstances, but not so much the morning of the marathon. In the future
  find out public transport details and work back to a place to stay from
  there.
- Gels every 4 km might have worked in training, but seems like it was
  ambitious for the race. Harder effort than a long run and 4 km goes by
  several minutes more quickly. Either base them on time or just stick to 5 km.
- Write down waaaay more splits on my arms, calculating things was just not
  working very well. Apparently you can get one of those fake tattoos with
  splits, maybe that is an option too.
