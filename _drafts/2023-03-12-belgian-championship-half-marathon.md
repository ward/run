The [Belgian Half Marathon Championship][bkhalf] last year was my second time
running a half marathon. That time I set a PR at 1:16:43. This year the same
group was handling the organisation. A flat course and avoiding too many turns.
A field of competitors aiming to run fast and limited to those running 80
minutes or faster. What's not to love?

## Training

As [described before][winterbase], I spent the winter building my base. Almost
exclusively calm running to give whatever was causing the hip niggle to pop up
from time to time the chance to fully disappear (knock on wood). Meanwhile
pushing my weekly distance up to 120 km and holding it at that consistently.
Also made me add a mid-week (mid-)long run, usually of about 23 km once I hit
120 km weeks. All singles.

I decided to start reintroducing workouts in the week of 30 Jan-5 Feb, i.e.,
six weeks before the race (including race week). I will count down in this
section. Workouts are described in terms of their goal effort / planned idea. I
ran quite some by feel because of the undulating terrain, so that confuses the
matter further. Up weeks I aim for 120 km total, long run of 30 km. A usual
split over the week would be: 18, 14, 23, 14, 11, 30, and 10 km. All the rest
and meaningful deviations are mentioned explicitly further down.

_Week 6._ Monday I planned 2×3k LT, but because of a red light that became 3k,
~1.5k, and ~1.5k. Paces averaged 3:47, 3:42, and 3:52. Heartrate seemed to be
high 150s until the final km which was low 160s.

Wednesday I tried Marathon pace, something I had never done before. I was not
signed up for a marathon, but was tentatively trying to get into Rotterdam (16
April) still. When I saw Rotterdam had sold out, I realised I _was_ for the
first time in my life actually in the mood to try a marathon. Despite being
sold out, people can still put their bibs up for sale in case they got injured
or something similar. If I managed to at some point get a bib that way, I
wanted to at least have given Marathon pace a try beforehand. Wednesday was a
first try at that. I set out to do 12 km. Pace wise the calculators put me
around a 2h40 marathon (3:47-3:48 per km). I ended up aiming for that as the
faster end of a slightly more conservative range: 3:47-3:54. I had no heart
rate to aim for and the terrain was still undulating, so feeling wise I settled
on "feels easier than LT, but you gotta remember to push harder than regular
running". Splits were: 3:40, :54, :34, :45, :50, :59, 4:13, 3:38, 3:55, 3:57,
4:02, and 3:58. Heart rate apparently hovered around 155-157. I don't really
look at my watch during this. Just vibes. Also am doing Citystrides at the same
time (and really for almost all my runs) and it turns out dead ends are not
great when you're pushing the pace some.

Later that week my left hip area felt a bit more tired than I liked, so I
decided to do just one workout per week the rest of the weeks, replacing a
workout day with strides instead. No point overdoing things when you are coming
back to the harder work.

_Week 5._ Monday I did some strides. I do not really count them any more, just
winging it that I will hit something in the 6-8 range. Tends to work out.
Wednesday I did 12k Marathon pace again. Again mostly by feel, though I glanced
at my watch if I noticed it buzzing. Parts of these were on earth frozen into
weird angles which I had to navigate a bit carefully to not twist an ankle.
Other parts had thawed in the sun and instead of a muddy slippery upper layer.
That said, most sections were fine. Tried a gel to see what the stomach would
say: it was fine. Splits: 3:42, :59, :47, 4:03, 3:46, :49, :52, 4:03, 3:51,
:48, :38, :50. Heart rate in the low 150s, so that was likely not hard enough.

_Week 4._ I took a down week so that I could do two more up weeks before race
week. Two days with strides, a 25 km long run. 96 km total.

_Week 3._ Monday was strides again. By this point I had actually signed up for
the half marathon (I don't think I had yet the weeks prior), so I switched away
from Marathon pace and did some LT again on Wednesday. Planned to do 3×3k,
which comes down to about 30 minutes total. Aim for ~2 minute break in-between
reps. Seems I went by vibes again. If taking it more seriously on the flat, the
goal would probably be about 3:35 per km. Actual split: 3:43, :34, :40, jog,
3:29, :35, :50, jog, :49, :42, :49. Average: 3:41 per km. As before: undulating
and citystrides. Heart rate high 150s, low 160s near the end. Was happy when I
neared the end of the workout. I recall back in the day aiming more for like
170 for LT work though, so I might be taking these too easily. The realisation
did not bother me. I'm having fun. Felt a bit deflated for Saturday's long run,
like when you run out of carby energy. Not sure what was up with that, don't
think it was related to anything.

_Week 2._ Monday strides again, Wednesday 3×3k Threshold again. Same caveats.
Paces: 3:34, :41, :44, jog, 46, :32, :53, jog, :33, :27, :48. Average: 3:39. HR
a bit lower than last time. Was wearing chest strap and not sure if it connects
up perfectly. Eventually reached 160 in the last km.

_Week 1, race week._ Distances for the week: 13-16.5-13.5-13.5-10-6-24. Tuesday
I did race pace / threshold. By this I mean I wanted to see what a sub 1:15
half marathon might feel like, so I set out to do 2×2k at 3:33 per km. It was a
shitty day raining through the night, morning, and during the lunch workout.
Headwind for the stretch I planned to do the workout and there were soooo many
puddles everywhere. Sunday was also looking shit, so I saw it as a good test in
all manners. Felt a bit out of it in the warmup, but I was not deterred.
Splits: 3:31, :34, jog, :35, :31. Average: 3:33 per km. Perfecto. Heart rate
settled around 165 bpm. Feels like: maybe just a bit too fast for an entire
half marathon. Thursday and Saturday, I threw in some strides to keep the legs
on their toes (badumtsj).

## Goal and Strategy

My obvious goal was to PR, beating last year's 1:16:43. I was not sure what
shape I was actually in though. I had been running a decent amount, but not as
much of it fast. What could I run? Eventually I thought "sub 1:15 looks pretty,
let's do that". Was I capable of it? No clue. Did I mind blowing up trying?
Nah, just go for it. A true scientific approach. (Note: this is why I did the
workout I did the Tuesday before the race, I wanted _some_ feel of the pace)

## Pre-Race

I had to wake up at 6:00 to get ready and catch my train. Had my usual bowl of
muesli with soy milk (150g muesli, 300g soy milk). Did not have time for tea,
so just had some water. I took the metro to catch a train and brought a bike
along. Once dropped in Ghent by the train, I biked the last 4 km to the stadium
from which he race starts. Could have also taken a bus for that part, but would
have involved more waiting around in the station.

Tried to use the bathroom (and would continue doing that periodically prerace
just in case). Grabbed my bib. Went to sit in the cafeteria to pin the bib onto
my singlet and the guy on the next table over was mentioning the wind might
make this tricky. It did not seem to have bothered him in the end… :)

_Bashir Abdi image and mention his finish time._

Started some stretches, tried to time my getting ready to not stand around too
long. It was around 8C and cloudy. Shorts and singlets would be fine for
running, not as much for standing still. Eventually changed and dropped off my
bag.<!-- The bag drop off looked well managed. You hand it off to a person and
it is put in an area that others cannot enter. Felt safe to leave all my stuff
and not wear running belt. -->

Ran maybe 2 km total as a warmup. Did two strides. They announced the start
would be soon so went on over the start area. The organisation had placed some
signs so you knew where to line up: sub 65, 65-70, 70-75, and 75-80 minutes.
The signs also said there would be pacers from 75 minutes and faster, spread
out around every 2-3 minutes. None of us where I was lined up actually saw the
75 minute pacer though. Oh well. After a bit of an extra wait because the
police was still clearing the course, we eventually got ready and waited for
the gun.
