The [Belgian Half Marathon Championship][bkhalf] last year was my second time
running a half marathon. That time I set a PR at 1:16:43. This year the same
group was handling the organisation. A flat course and avoiding too many turns.
A field of competitors aiming to run fast and limited to those running 80
minutes or faster. What's not to love?

## Training

As [described before][winterbase], I spent the winter building my base. Almost
exclusively calm running to give whatever was causing the hip niggle to pop up
from time to time the chance to fully disappear (knock on wood). Meanwhile
pushing my weekly distance up to 120 km and holding it at that consistently.
Also made me add a mid-week (mid-)long run, usually of about 23 km once I hit
120 km weeks. All singles.

I decided to start introducing workouts in the week of 30 Jan-5 Feb. Six weeks
before the race (including race week). I will count down in this section.

Week 6.

Week 5.

Week 4.

Week 3.

Week 2.

Week 1, race week.

## Goal and Strategy

My obvious goal was to PR, beating last year's 1:16:43. I was not sure what
shape I was actually in though. I had been running a decent amount, but not as
much of it fast. What could I run? Eventually I thought "sub 1:15 looks pretty,
let's do that". Was I capable of it? No clue. Did I mind blowing up trying?
Nah, just go for it. A true scientific approach.

## Pre-Race

I had to wake up at 6:00 to get ready and catch my train. Had my usual bowl of
muesli with soy milk (150g muesli, 300g soy milk). Did not have time for tea,
so just had some water. I took the metro to catch a train and brought a bike
along. Once dropped in Ghent by the train, I biked the last 4 km to the stadium
from which he race starts. Could have also taken a bus for that part, but would
have involved more waiting around in the station.

Tried to use the bathroom (and would continue doing that periodically prerace
just in case). Grabbed my bib. Went to sit in the cafeteria to pin the bib onto
my singlet and the guy on the next table over was mentioning the wind might
make this tricky. It did not seem to have bothered him in the endâ€¦ :)

_Bashir Abdi image and mention his finish time._

Started some stretches, tried to time my getting ready to not stand around too
long. It was around 8C and cloudy. Shorts and singlets would be fine for
running, not as much for standing still. Eventually changed and dropped off my
bag.<!-- The bag drop off looked well managed. You hand it off to a person and
it is put in an area that others cannot enter. Felt safe to leave all my stuff
and not wear running belt. -->

Ran maybe 2 km total as a warmup. Did two strides. They announced the start
would be soon so went on over the start area. The organisation had placed some
signs so you knew where to line up: sub 65, 65-70, 70-75, and 75-80 minutes.
The signs also said there would be pacers from 75 minutes and faster, spread
out around every 2-3 minutes. None of us where I was lined up actually saw the
75 minute pacer though. Oh well. After a bit of an extra wait because the
police was still clearing the course, we eventually got ready and waited for
the gun.
