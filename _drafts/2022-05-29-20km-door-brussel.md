After [last fall's][bxl2021] disappointment due to food poisoning, I had
decided that I would "get some revenge" this time around. In the weeks and
months leading up to it, however, I realised I did not really care. I had run a
good (flat!) half in March and the hilly 20 km door Brussel was losing its
appeal. A week before the race though, I found out it was going to be a cool
day. Low 10s C, possible clouds. I felt the itch to give it a go after all and
signed up Tuesday, with the race on Sunday. No elite bib for me this time
because they had already run out. It seems more people are interested in racing
again now that COVID is "solved".

## Training

After the [interclub][interclub] three weeks ago, I had a little niggle that
made me abandon the plans I had to start proper workouts again. I gave it
another week of easy running instead, with elliptical on Sunday after a night
of too much drinking and not enough sleeping. Last week I then tried a little
Threshold-of-sorts workout. I only did 2 km at higher pace and it was not quite
fast enough, but I figured just something to get the legs moving would have to
do. My long run on Saturday was longer than usual: 32 km in the hilly Ardennes
versus the usual flatter 27-28 km. Finally, this week is also race week. I
ended up with 14k, 13k, 12.5k, 13k, 10k, and 6k. Tuesday had a few strides and
a km around goal race pace. Saturday some final strides.

So to summarise: prior to interclub week was just maintaining base. Interclub
week was 101 km with a little workout and two races. Week after was 101 km, no
workouts. Last week was 111 km with rustbuster workout and a heftier long run.
Race week had some race pace and strides but mostly controlling the volume.

## Goal and Strategy

I have kept the same goal as in fall: 1:13:xx. I always try to plan out how to
tackle the paces in this race, but in reality I will just end up ignoring it
anyway. Probably just aim for the 3:40-3:45 range at the start and then see how
it ends up going.

One data point I hope to remember as I write this part out prior to the race:
in the half marathon in March, my heart rate was 165 and up but remained under
170 till perhaps 14 km when it hovered at 170. Then from 16-17 km I started my
"push" towards the finish and it went up a few beats more to around 175. I
think that might have been a bit too controlled still, so going a little harder
could be appropriate.
