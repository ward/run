After [last fall's][bxl2021] disappointment due to food poisoning, I had
decided that I would "get some revenge" this time around. In the weeks and
months leading up to it, however, I realised I did not really care. I had run a
good (flat!) half in March and the hilly 20 km door Brussel was losing its
appeal. A week before the race though, I found out it was going to be a cool
day. Low 10s C, possible clouds. I felt the itch to give it a go after all and
signed up Tuesday, with the race on Sunday. No elite bib for me this time
because they had already run out. It seems more people are interested in racing
again now that COVID is "solved".

## Training

After the [interclub][interclub] three weeks ago, I had a little niggle that
made me abandon the plans I had to start proper workouts again. I gave it
another week of easy running instead, with elliptical on Sunday after a night
of too much drinking and not enough sleeping. Last week I then tried a little
Threshold-of-sorts workout. I only did 2 km at higher pace and it was not quite
fast enough, but I figured just something to get the legs moving would have to
do. My long run on Saturday was longer than usual: 32 km in the hilly Ardennes
versus the usual flatter 27-28 km. Finally, this week is also race week. I
ended up with 14k, 13k, 12.5k, 13k, 10k, and 6k. Tuesday had a few strides and
a km around goal race pace. Saturday some final strides.

So to summarise: prior to interclub week was just maintaining base. Interclub
week was 101 km with a little workout and two races. Week after was 101 km, no
workouts. Last week was 111 km with rustbuster workout and a heftier long run.
Race week had some race pace and strides but mostly controlling the volume.

## Goal and Strategy

I have kept the same goal as in fall: 1:13:xx. I always try to plan out how to
tackle the paces in this race, but in reality I will just end up ignoring it
anyway. Probably just aim for the 3:40-3:45 range at the start and then see how
it ends up going.

One data point I hope to remember as I write this part out prior to the race:
in the half marathon in March, my heart rate was 165 and up but remained under
170 till perhaps 14 km when it hovered at 170. Then from 16-17 km I started my
"push" towards the finish and it went up a few beats more to around 175. I
think that might have been a bit too controlled still, so going a little harder
could be appropriate.

## Pre Race

My night was not perfect, but nowhere near as bad as before the last 20 km.
There was some festival happening a kilometre or so away and their music was
_so loud_. I could not drown it out while in the bedroom with earplugs in even.
I had hoped to (try to) sleep by around 22:00. Instead it was not till 1:00,
when the festival finally ended. I got tempted to call the police about a noise
complaint. I have gotten old.

Woke up as planned at 7:00, basically copying older schedules. Quickly try to
get my breakfast (140g muesli, double that soy milk) and a cup of black tea
down. Spend the rest of the morning trying to use the toilet as much as
possible. Left home a little past 8:30, not quite sure I was all emptied out,
but it would have to be enough. Arrived by 9:30ish at the "Les Gazelles de
Bruxelles" tent I was expecting to find in the same location as last time. Said
some "hi"s, did some leg swings to warm up the hips. Went to have a look at a
port-a-potty just in case, but the line was long and in the end there was no
toilet paper anyway.

Did a bit of jogging back and forth, then went to sneak into the elite corral.
No way was I going to start in box 1 mostly behind 6000 people in the
"1:14:00-1:34:59" range. I was not the only one to do this. Them running out of
elite bibs made it a bit of a shitshow perhaps. Either way, gave my wife my
sweater and jogged some more in the corral. Bumped into Dieter, who I had met
at a race in Mechelen back in maybe September and then again at the last 20 km.
We talked a bit, shared goals, got on with our warmups. An off-hand comment the
day before had made me think about something though: Dieter and I were
neck-and-neck in the 5000 we raced in Mechelen, why not just stick with him?

The officials made another attempt at filtering out non-elite people, but that
was a mess and I avoided "detection". I lined up a few rows down in the elite
box, ready for racing.

## Race

Just like last year, we were placed a little ways away from the actual start
line. I have no clue why they keep doing that. Looking over people (it helps to
be taller than your average distance runner), I noticed the start line's bottle
neck was even worse than usual. Besides being just a bit wider than a van, as
usual, there were also two about knee-height hills on each side, around where
the wheels of said van would be. I had no clue what that was about, my guess is
something from the park service to keep cars out? I did however realise I would
want to aim for the exact middle of the start line. Those hills looked a mess.

The gun went off and there was the usual congested jog towards the start line
(well, besides from those actually trying to win the race). I was not stressed.
It helped that I did _not_ have an elite bib now, so I knew I was going to get
chip time instead of gun time. The pace picked up and as we cross around the
start line, the little hills are doing what I feared... but only to others.
Some people struggling, at least one falling. Unrelated to the hill, a guy
right in front of me fell over a circular sewer access TODO WHAT WORD. Rather,
the access was a bit lower than the rest of the surface, creating a little
step. Guy in front of me must have hit it and he face planted. Whoops. I yelled
what a mess this was, waved my arms to warn others, and ran past the guy on the
floor. There must have been more casualties of either that or the two hills, a
guy two or three runners in front of me was rubbing and looking at his upper
leg / lower butt.

With that behind us, I focused on what felt like an OK effort. The first TODO
HOW LONG is still downhill, so the pace is high. After that we are running
towards the royal park, a bit more ups, still some downs. I was passing people,
people were passing me, it was the usual mess in the early parts of a race.
Looking at my watch, the pace was a bit hot, but I had decided on glancing at
my heart rate instead of my pace by this point and that was still fine.
