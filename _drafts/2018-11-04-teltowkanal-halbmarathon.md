Somewhere in summer, I was looking for a fall goal to set. The girlfriend felt
we should combine a city trip with a race.  To do so, I felt it had to be a
half marathon length. Making the effort of flying somewhere for something
shorter felt like a bit of a waste.  Sadly, I did not know my work schedule at
the time yet, so that left us with very few options. Only the long weekend of 1
November to 4 November, I was sure to be able to travel.

The girlfriend searched around and stumbled on the Teltowkanal Halbmarathon
just south of Berlin on 4 November. Neither of us had been to Berlin, so that
worked out nicely. The longest I had raced so far were editions of the Brussels
20 km, a hilly race in the warmer weather of the end of May. I was on board
with finding out what I could do on a mostly flat course on a chilly day
instead.

After making my intentions clear on ARTC, it turned out that Johannes, someone
I knew there, had run this one last year and was planning on doing so again.
Competition!

## Course Details

You start facing a bridge over the Teltowkanal from the Berlin side. You cross
it to the Brandenburg side (~100m) and make a turn to the right.  You run out
300 metre, turn left and up, come onto a street and run back to the bridge. You
run a little bit onto the bridge again, but before crossing you turn right onto
a cement path along the canal. You are around 800 metre into the race at this
point. The first of two water stands (per lap) is also around here. You follow
this largely flat (there are maybe two little "peaks" of going up sharply going
up a few metres followed by going down again) and largely straight path till
you are a little over 3.5 km into the race. Then follows a brief little climb
towards a bridge which you cross to reach the Berlin side of the canal again.
Time to run back.

The ground on this side is less smooth. The first 800ish metre is alright,
if a bit bumpier than the other side. You get stamped earth with rocks (the
gravelly stuff you might find in park paths). The path is a bit narrower and
there might be some rocks or roots sticking out here and there. All the things
sticking out were marked with bright red paint. I do not know if the organisers
did this or if this is standard on this path, but I appreciated that. Next you
get 400-500 metre of actual road (and thus a lot of space). They also parked
the second water stand here. Things narrow again and the ground is a bit worse
then before, more things sticking out, some sand patches.  You get around 800
metre of this.

Over the next 100 metre you turn right and left while climbing on cobbles in
order to reach a wooden planks bridge.  Cross it (you are still on the same
side of the canal), head back down and reach a sandy path. The narrow path from
before still accommodated two people next to each other, now it becomes worse
than that. Lots and lots of roots and edges too. You suffer through this for
700ish metre, climb some cobble stairs, turn left, and arrive back at where you
started.

This loop is done three times for the half marathon. In the final lap, you run
to the other side of the bridge where the finish lies.

## Training

I outlined my original plan in my [planning of fall 2018][fall2018] and looked
back at parts of it in the reports of the races I did this cycle:

- [Brickfields parkrun (5 km)][brickfields] (9 weeks out)
- [Jogging '80 (10 km)][jogging80] (4 weeks out)
- [Brussels Canal Run (9 km)][bxlcanal] (2 weeks out)

Each of those reports have a "Training" section that reflects on the training
leading up to that race.  I will give the general outline here, some
highlights, and some more detail on ups and downs since the last race.

My main idea this cycle (and this year) has been to stay consistent and to not
overestimate my body's capabilities. I decided the "start" of this cycle was 11
weeks out from race week (so a 12 week plan, as many race plans are). Right
before this cycle, I had bumped my weekly distance to 80 km, a new all time
high for me. Most plans have you building up and peaking in distance during the
plan. I was however not willing to artificially drop my distance to start a
plan, nor was I willing to bump further than around that 80 km per week mark
during the plan. So that immediately scratched distance peaking. Instead I
decided to stick to 80 km weeks, with a rest week of 60 km every fourth week.

Intensity wise I will use Jack Daniels terms to explain. I did Tempos
throughout the cycle. The first four weeks also had a week with a Repetition, a
week with a Time Trial race, and a week with a race where no competition showed
up, so that turned into another Tempo. Next four weeks had two weeks with an
Interval session and another week with a race. The two weeks before the taper I
dropped some workouts due to feeling tired and not wanting to risk it. I just
did the one Tempo workout. Those two weeks ended with the [Brussels Canal
Run][bxlcanal] referred to before. I hope it goes without saying that
throughout all of this, I am also doing weekly Long runs and strides where I
think it fits in.

Most of this cycle went pretty well. Five weeks out I put my body through a lot
by also having to attend a conference, which ended up getting me sick (throat,
slight fever, super tired, that kind of stuff) on and off for about a week.
Since then I have been paying more attention to drinking hot teas and some
throat tablets when I think I feel it coming up. Besides that I had usual bouts
of tiredness and terrible sleep from time to time, my sleep has always been an
iffy thing.

My taper started after the Brussels Canal Run by dropping the distance to what
I run in recovery weeks (~60 km), but still keeping some workouts in.
Specifically: a tempo on Wednesday in week one, a slightly shorter long run on
Sunday in week one, and a race pace workout on Tuesday in race week. Those last
two especially gave me a great confidence boost and are two of the three
workouts I think I want to highlight from this training cycle.

### Highlighted Workouts

In chronological order.

1. [Interval / VO2max: 4Ã—1000 @ 3:40][vo2max4times1000] on 18 September 2018 (6
   weeks out). Aimed for 3:40 / km pace. Splits were -4, 0, 0, and -4. I
   believe this may be my first such workout where I picked the right pace, or
   rather, where I did not pick a pace with which I completely blew up. It was
   a glorious feeling at the time. The only nagging doubt at the time was
   whether I perhaps picked too slow a pace then. In retrospect, looking at
   what I have run since, I believe it was pretty much spot on.
2. [Long run: 16 km @ 4:21][finallongrun] on 28 October 2018 (7 days out). It
   it a bit cheating to take something from the more tapered body, but this run
   (and the next one) were such confidence boosters that I cannot exclude it.
   Unlike almost all of my runs, this was a flat run. The weather was also just
   great with a rainy start and about 10C. I did not aim for any particular
   pace during this run, with the hills in Brussels I have given up on that,
   and was just running by heart rate as always. I can tell you that clocking
   off these splits had me worried to the point that I thought my heart rate
   monitor might be broken, but really it was just a great feeling run.
3. [Race pace: 3 km @ 4:00][racepace] on 30 October 2018 (5 days out). After
   that great Sunday run, this was to be the final test and boy did it boost my
   confidence further. I split 3:57, 3:52, 3:57 and it just felt _easy_.

## Goals and Strategy

Before the start of the cycle, the goal was just to get a better pace than what
I ran at the 20 km door Brussel at the end of May.  I ran that one in 1:27:59,
which is 4:24 per km. The 20 km was a hot day on a hilly route, so I figured
that is the least I should be able to do.

Shortly into the cycle, Johannes said we should go for sub 90. He had already
beaten me handily several times in the ARTC Mooseleague races (track
distances), so not to be outdone, I agreed with the idea. Internally, however,
I was wondering if that was really possible. Sub 90 requires a 4:16 per km pace
which is already a decent chunk faster than what I ran in the 20 km.

About three weeks out from race day, I started thinking more seriously about
what pace I would be able to run.  I did not have a proper recent race to go
by, so I tried using my times from training to work back to a race pace.
Usually the tables expect you to enter a recent race time and they will tell
you what paces to train at. I figured if I manage some training runs on the
flat, I could work back from that to a race time to aim for. *Note: I did not
realise this at the time, but JD actually gives using a Tempo as an option if
you do not have a recent race to go by.* Doing so said I should go sub 85 on
the half.  *Record stopping scratchy noise.* What?

TODO: Canal run as test, good taper runs, going for it

## Getting There in Pieces

I knew some travel would be required to take part in the race, but it ended up
a bit more than I bargained for.  Maybe a month out, the girlfriend's brother
said he would be in Barcelona.  We decided to meet up with him there since she
had not seen him in a while, we would be there from Friday to the Tuesday
before the race.  Sadly, there were some strikes in Brussels Airport that
forced us to use different airports. This extended the travel time from a few
hours to at least half a day and many uncomfortable bus hours added into the
already uncomfortable trip. This happened both in going and in returning from
Barcelona.

Luckily, getting to Berlin Wednesday evening was smooth.  However, I had
trouble sleeping in the hotel's bed: the mattress was old, hanging down too
much in the middle and I could feel the springs pressing against me. Thursday
night, I only slept five hours. Friday night, the same happened. A far cry from
the nine or more that I prefer. While slightly worrying, I am also often in a
not-enough-sleep situation, so I figured I could still make do.  It helped that
we changed to a hotel in Teltow the night before the race. The bed in this
hotel was better and after napping in it in the afternoon, I slept about nine
and a half hours during the night.

What had me worried as all hell was something else. Friday morning after the
first bites of breakfast (some "weltmeister" bread roll we had bought in a
Lidl), I felt my stomach cramping. I do not know if it was that bread, if it
was the pho from the night before, or something else. It hurt and it would hurt
whenever I ate something for that entire day.

After returning from a shakeout at the Hasenheide parkrun on Saturday, the
healing process started. By this I mean that I had diarrhoea throughout the
rest of the day. It sucked, but my stomach area felt a little bit better after
the first round. I tried my best to drink enough water to not get dehydrated.
Beside that I just let myself be miserable all day and hoped my body would fix
itself by the time the race started.

Morning of the race, this did not quite seem to be the case. Stomach still felt
so-so and there was still some bowel emptying.  I had a banana and some
"breakfast cookie" pack about three hours before the race and then just focused
on getting everything out and putting enough water in. In-between we picked up
the bibs from the start area.  I made good use of our hotel near the start (~1
km away) by just preparing and using the toilet right there. Eventually the
girlfriend and I jogged over at about 10:15, 15 minutes before the start of the
race. I did not see Johannes and people were already moving to line up at the
start.  We walked in the same direction, I took a quick pee on the side, and
squeezed in around the fifth row.  With a minute or two before the race start,
I heard my name. Johannes was another five rows or so back from me.  I waved
him good luck and got ready to race. I just hoped my bowels would leave me
alone.

## Race

- Not too messy start for me, but probably because enough near the front and on the outside of the first turn
- After a km or two, settle in behind a woman in black and, eventually, a guy with orange shorts/shoes.
- Follow till 9-10 km
- Woman starts slowing down some, few meter gap on the guy. Watch tells me she is going too slow
- I close the gap, woman tries holding on too still
- Still does not feel quite right pacewise, watch confirms
- I get to the front of our little group and just focus on my own race
- Alone for the rest of the race, not counting people I pass
- Start of the second lap sees a bit of a slow down.
- After 2 km someone in blue zooms past me, briefly hold on
- See the watch jump to 3:45ish, let him go
- Use it as a motivator to get my pace somewhat right again at least
- Already a bit more crowded with people on their second lap still, but enough room on this side
- Other side it gets pretty bad, I have to yell "pardon" very often. Bloody people with headphones
- Still, make do
- Have the perfect cup throw
- Twist ankle with maybe 1km to go, lots of swearing in dutch/french. A guy I was about to pass says some things, I cannot make it out. Hope he did not think I was swearing at him
- Either way, not letting this go bad with 1 km to go, force form back, focus on getting home
- Damned final stairs
- Finish \o/
