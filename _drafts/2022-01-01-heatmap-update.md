I have [previously talked about my heatmap goals][heatmapgoals]. With the year
coming to an end, I felt like giving an update and writing out what I see
myself focusing on in 2022.

## Plans For 2022

- Finish Brussels. The order of communes does not matter much.
- Extra sweep for streets marked complete on CS but not actually complete

  to, run there, bike back.
