We went to Slovenia the other week. I have come to the realisation that I
forget too much about some of my other trips, instead piecing things together
based on photos when I look at them years later. In an attempt to change this a
little, I thought I'd write some thoughts about it down. Maybe just go full
diary-with-pictures at it. A lot of the trip was running and walking around, so
it seemed fitting enough to post it here. In total we ended up spending seven
days there that I could say something meaningful about, so I will just go
through those here too.

## Day 1: Lost in the Woods and Too Much Hiking

### A Run

{% include location.html lat=46.3105 lon=13.9946 description="The forest I got a little lost in on this run." %}

I had only planned a 10k run this morning and spotted a loop on the map that
would take me through some forests as well as the next town over. The parts in
the forests were not marked trails. I was not aware of this fact, nor did I
realise it actually mattered. Instead these seemed to be paths used for logging
and as such, were not quite as consistent with the map as I had hoped. My
original path ended up stopping in a tree wasteland.

No worries, there was a side path that seemed to get me in largely the right
direction so I followed that instead. Repeat this a few times. Eventually, only
a slow and steep 1.6 km into the run, the path ended at a horse pasture with
fencing. I did not feel like going back the way I came and instead spotted
another steep upwards path that looked passable. Half a km further this ended
in a tree wasteland, another logging path.

Kind of sick of this, I just decided to push straight through the woods up
ahead. There was no path, but (1) I figured it was generally the right
direction, and (2) I was hoping there might be a path popping up that was not
on the map. As luck would have it, a path did appear! I followed this for a
while, thinking it would lead somewhere. It did. You guessed it. Another tree
wasteland. However! In the distance I could make out an actual road, so once
more I decided to just push through the woods. Slow going, but the right
direction. I was a bit over this forest run. I ended up finding some fields,
running straight through those and making it to the road in the end. I was
maybe 3 km into the run and 40 minutes had passed. Whoops.

After that I stuck to some roads, found an actual marked trail up to a view
point, and finished the rest of the 10 km in less time than those first 3.

### A Hike

{% include location.html lat=46.2947 lon=13.8754 description="The first viewpoint on our climb, we went a little further still." %}

The hike planned today started in the village of Stara Fužina. We would end up
here a few more times this trip. From Stara Fužina, we went north-westish to
climb up to Vogar. I am still not sure if this is an actual named hill or the
name of the few houses at the top there. Either way, it was upwards from where
we started. Steeply upwards. We climbed around 500 meter, most of it across a
2.5 km stretch. That makes it pretty steadily around 20%. I am not sure what I
expected on this trip, but that was a bit of a rougher start than anticipated.

There were two nice viewpoints at the top and we watched paragliders take off
from the side of the hill for a while. Nice and relaxing before bombing back
down ourselves, no easy feat at that steepness. The terrain was also _very_
rocky, so you had to keep paying attention throughout. All in all that ended up
being a nearly 9 km walk with over 2h30 of moving time. Legs were tired from
the steepness, but I figured that was it for the day.

We immediately went to a restaurant in the village there (Residence Triglav
{% include location.html lat=46.28408 lon=13.89142 description="The restaurant is part of a hotel, luckily you do not need to be staying in the hotel to enjoy the meals." %})
which is a bit pricier than most places in the area, but was pretty fancy and
looked nice.

### A Hike Too Many

{% include location.html lat=46.35705 lon=14.07461 description="The top of our second climb of the day, having started in the center of Bled on the east side of the lake." %}

After that we went to the village of Bled, known for its lake with a church on
the island in the middle. I figured it would just be some sightseeing and
scoping out a place for the girlfriend who had to work the next day. We walked
a little bit, had a drink in a café that seemed to have good wifi for tomorrow,
then continued walking some more. The plan was to stroll around the lake a bit.

The stroll turned into a "let's climb this mountain on the other side" when we
passed by the west side of the lake. Apparently there were three view points up
there. When the girlfriend and her sister had made this trip about two years
ago, they had only managed to do one of them, getting lost after that and not
caring enough to press on. So up we went.

The view is nice enough, you see the lake from above, you get a good view on
the church on the island in the middle. Postcard picture. The different view
points were all pretty much the same to me though, so that got less
interesting. Legs were also not very happy any more: getting to the viewpoints
meant more climbing. Either way, we managed them all, climbing from just under
500m elevation to about 750m of elevation in the span of 2ish km. Yup, that was
steep again. Once done, we still had to walk back along the lake to the village
again too.

The Bled walking ended up totalling about 10km, 3 hours of moving time. By the
end we were all pretty done with it and dragged ourselves to an Asian
restaurant, no local cuisine tonight. After stuffing our faces we felt better,
but I was definitely hoping not every day would end up like this.

## Day 2: More Bled

{% include location.html lat=46.4008 lon=14.0993 description="Slap Šum (Šum waterfall)" %}

The girlfriend had to start work relatively early and I was not going to wake
up early enough, so my run was pushed to later in the day. Instead, we dropped
the girlfriend at the café while her sister and I continued on to the Vintgar
gorge (along the Radovna river) and the Šum waterfall at the end ("Slap Šum",
Slap being Slovenian for waterfall). The walk was pretty, the waterfall itself
underwhelming. Coming at the end of July might have made there not be enough
water to make it a nice sight. Bummer.

After getting back, we went to the girlfriend to say hi and rest briefly. We
then bought some lunch in the supermarket, checked out the castle on the north
side of Bled and then the toboggan on the south side of Bled. Looking back at
this, the walking was not super crazy, but my legs were a bit fed up with the
need to keep moving.

Once the girlfriend was done work, I changed into running clothes. She and her
sister would walk around the lake, I would run two laps.  After I finished
that, I jumped into the lake to cool down and wash off the worst of the sweat.
The water was not too cold once you were in, luckily. This way I did not have
to shower and we could immediately continue on to dinner. Tonight's dinner was
more traditional, in the "Gostilnica Štrudl" (
{% include location.html lat=46.27262 lon=14.95303 description="Gostilnica Štrudl restaurant." %})
where I consumed too many strudls and had some nice local craft beer (Jezernik
Summer Ale by Lintvern brewery).
