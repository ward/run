We went to Slovenia for a week at the end of July. I have come to the
realisation that I forget too much about some of my other trips, instead
piecing things together based on photos when I look at them years later. In an
attempt to change this a little, I thought I'd write some thoughts about it
down. Maybe just go full diary-with-pictures at it. A lot of the trip was
running and walking around, so it seemed fitting enough to post it here. In
total we ended up spending seven days there that I could say something
meaningful about, so I will just go through those one by one. (We arrived late
the day before day 1 and just immediately went to bed)

I wrote all of this in the weeks following the trip and selected photos at the
time too. Then I completely ignored finishing the report till I figured at the
end of December that I really should get it done. I processed the photos and
did a final proofread. Procrastination at its finest.

Maybe one more TODO: umap (or just a picture) with the locations we passed by
(numbered).

## Day 1: Lost in the Woods and Too Much Hiking

### A Run

{% include location.html lat=46.3105 lon=13.9946 description="The forest I got a little lost in on this run." %}

I had only planned a 10k run this morning and spotted a loop on the map that
would take me through some forests as well as the next town over. The parts in
the forests were not marked trails. I was not aware of this fact, nor did I
realise it actually mattered. Instead these seemed to be paths used for logging
and, as such, were not quite as consistent with the map as I had hoped. My
original path ended up stopping in a tree wasteland.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210726_084308.webp' description='Tree wasteland. Lots of those on this run.' %}

No worries, there was a side path that seemed to get me in largely the right
direction! I followed that instead. Repeat this process a few times.
Eventually, only a slow and steep 1.6 km into the run, the path ended at a
horse pasture with fencing. I did not feel like going back the way I came and
instead spotted another steep upwards path that looked passable. Half a km
further this ended in another tree wasteland, it was just another logging path.

Kind of sick of this, I just decided to push straight through the woods up
ahead. There was no path, but (1) I figured it was generally the right
direction, and (2) I was hoping there might be a path popping up that was not
on the map. As luck would have it, a path did appear! I followed this for a
while, thinking it would lead somewhere. It did. You guessed it. Another tree
wasteland. However! In the distance I could make out an actual road, so once
more I decided to just push through the woods. Slow going, but the right
direction. I was a bit over this forest run. I ended up finding some fields,
running straight through those and making it to the road in the end. I was
maybe 3 km into the run and 40 minutes had passed. Whoops.

After that I stuck to some roads, found an actual marked trail up to a view
point, and finished the rest of the 10 km in less time than those first 3 km
had taken me.

Eagles something TODO Check name + confirm that the lake in the middle of the picture is the one we passed by a lot. Lake Bohinj next to Stara Fuzina?' %}

### A Hike

{% include location.html lat=46.2947 lon=13.8754 description="The first viewpoint on our climb, we went a little further still." %}

The hike planned today started in the village of Stara Fužina. We would end up
here a few more times this trip. From Stara Fužina, we went north-westish to
climb up to Vogar. I am still not sure if this is an actual named hill or the
name of the few houses at the top there. Either way, it was upwards from where
we started. Steeply upwards. We climbed around 500 vertical meter, most of it
across a 2.5 km stretch. That makes it pretty steadily around 20%. I am not
sure what I expected on this trip, but that was a bit of a rougher start than
anticipated.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210726_120122.webp' description='Watching paragliders jump off the hill.' %}

There were two nice viewpoints at the top and we watched paragliders take off
from the side of the hill for a while. A nice and relaxing moment for us, before we
bombed back down ourselves, no easy feat at that steepness. The terrain was
also _very_ rocky, so you had to keep paying attention throughout. All in all
that ended up being a nearly 9 km walk with over 2h30 of moving time. Legs were
tired from the steepness, but I figured that was it for the day.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210726_132950.webp' description='Rocky, steep. Got to stay focused.' %}

We immediately went to a restaurant in the village there (Residence Triglav {%
include location.html lat=46.28408 lon=13.89142 description="The restaurant is
part of a hotel, luckily you do not need to be staying in the hotel to enjoy
the meals." %}) which is a bit pricier than most places in this part of
Slovenia, but was pretty fancy and looked nice.

### A Hike Too Many

{% include location.html lat=46.3682 lon=14.1086 description="The village of Bled." %}

After that we went to the village of Bled, known for its lake with a church on
the island in the middle. I figured it would just be some sightseeing and
scoping out a place for the girlfriend, who had to work the next day and needed
a place with better WiFi than our Airbnb provided. We walked a little bit, had
a drink in a café that seemed to have good WiFi for tomorrow, then continued
walking some more. The plan was to stroll around the lake a bit.

{% include location.html lat=46.35705 lon=14.07461 description="The top of our second climb of the day, having started in the center of Bled on the east side of the lake." %}

The stroll turned into a "let's climb this mountain on the other side" when we
passed by the west side of the lake. Apparently there were three view points up
there. When the girlfriend and her sister had made this trip about two years
ago, they had only managed to do one of them, getting lost after that and not
caring enough to press on. So up we went.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210726_191141.webp' description='Lake Bled. Nice enough, but I did not care that much. Especially seeing it several times from just slightly different angles.' %}

The view is nice enough, you see the lake from above, you get a good view on
the church on the island in the middle. Postcard picture. The different view
points were all pretty much the same to me though, so that got less
interesting. Legs were also not very happy any more: getting to the viewpoints
meant more climbing. Either way, we managed them all, climbing from just under
500m elevation to about 750m of elevation in the span of 2ish km. Yup, that was
steep again. Once done, we still had to walk back along the lake to the village
again too.

The Bled walking ended up totalling about 10km, 3 hours of moving time. By the
end we were all pretty done with it and dragged ourselves to an Asian
restaurant, no local cuisine tonight. After stuffing our faces, we felt better,
but I was definitely hoping not every day would end up like this.

## Day 2: More Bled

{% include location.html lat=46.4008 lon=14.0993 description="Slap Šum (Šum waterfall)" %}

The girlfriend had to start work relatively early and I was not going to wake
up early enough to squeeze a run in before we had to leave, so my run was
pushed back to later in the day. We dropped the girlfriend at the café while
her sister and I continued on to the Vintgar gorge (along the Radovna river)
and the Šum waterfall at the end ("Slap Šum", Slap being Slovenian for
waterfall). The walk was pretty, the waterfall itself underwhelming. Coming at
the end of July might have made there not be enough water to make it a nice
sight. The girlfriend later assured me it had looked much better when she had
gone there in a different season. Bummer.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210727_104529.webp' description='Gorgeous Gorge. Mist hanging over the water.' %}
{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210727_105353.webp' description='Gorgeous Gorge.' %}

After getting back, we went to the girlfriend to say hi and rest briefly. We
then bought some lunch in the supermarket, checked out the castle on the north
side of Bled and then the toboggan on the south side of Bled. Looking back at
this, the walking was not super crazy, but my legs were a bit fed up with the
need to keep moving. I ended up walking nearly 14 km total.

Once the girlfriend was done work, I changed into running clothes. She and her
sister would walk around the lake, I would run two laps to get to 13 km. After
I finished that, I jumped into the lake to cool down and wash off the worst of
the sweat. The water was not too cold once you were in, luckily. Taking a lake
"bath" ensured I did not have to shower and we could immediately continue on to
dinner. Tonight's dinner was more traditional, in the "Gostilnica Štrudl" ( {%
include location.html lat=46.27262 lon=14.95303 description="Gostilnica Štrudl
restaurant." %}) where I consumed too many strudls and had some nice local
craft beer (Jezernik Summer Ale by Lintvern brewery).

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210727_190419.webp' description='A wonderful dip into Lake Bled to clean myself after running around it.' %}

## Day 3: Lake Bohinj and Viševnik

{% include location.html lat=46.28645 lon=13.88134 description="Location of Lake Bohinj that I ran around. Dipping in and chilling happened near the indicated location." %}

On this day, the girlfriend needed to work through the morning. She found a
bench in Stara Fužina, her sister went for a walk, and I went for a run. Having
done Lake Bled the day before, I decided to run around Lake Bohinj (Bohinjsko
jezero) today, another ~13 km run. The south side of the lake was a bit meh to
run along, there was a gravelly path, but there was a road for cars and a small
treeline between you and the lake. The north side was nicer, a more traily
experience, no cars, just nature and lake. Once the run was done, I dipped into
this lake too for a rinse. I had time to waste waiting for the girlfriend, so I
chilled in the water and on the beach for just shy of an hour. The sun was
shining so the water was quite nice. Just don't go deeper than 1m50 or so, it
quickly cools down significantly. Cold mountain water I presume. The area can
get pretty crowded with people, but I was lucky to be early enough and had some
peace and quiet. First truly relaxing moment of the trip? I enjoyed it, things
had been a bit too intense so far.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_105138.webp' description='A wonderful dip into Lake Bohinj to clean myself after running around it.' %}

Afterwards I made my way back to the girlfriend. I don't know if it was
something in the lake, but I was followed by a swarm of flies for almost a
kilometer. If I did not wave my arms around, they would all converge on my arms
and I would get a gross covering of flies chilling there. Seriously, really
gross. When I reached the village they finally left me alone.

{% include location.html lat=46.35898 lon=13.89824 description="Mount Viševnik" %}

In the afternoon, a climb up mount Viševnik was planned. We started around
1400m of elevation at Rudno Polje. You can park in the collection of four
buildings called Rudno Polje  and walk a little bit extra, or you can park in
the following spot right at the bottom of the ski slope and skip a small extra
walk ({% include location.html lat=46.3483 lon=13.9156 description="Informal
parking location right at the bottom of the ski slope." %}).  We climbed up,
first along that ski slope, but quickly on much more challenging rocky terrain
as we left the ski slope behind. The first 1.2 km averaged about 25% if I
calculated that right. Another day of steepness and paying attention to
footing. The views were great though: hulking mountains and deep valleys on all
sides. It's just not something you find in Belgium. Downside: the steepness
eventually got to my right achilles. I started feeling it, I had overused it a
little. About 2/3rds up the climb the complaining started and I had to stretch
and rest my legs a few times. I am not the most bendy at the ankles to begin
with, I imagine this does not help when going up so steep a climb.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_142443.webp' description='Views!' %}
{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_145634.webp' description='That white patch is ice/snow. We had to cross it to then go up the mountain in the background.' %}
{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_153114.webp' description='Looking back on the plateau with snow in it.' %}

As we neared the top, we saw what we think is an Alpine Ibex. The horns were a
bit short, so it would have to be a younger specimen (... or just some mountain
goat). Evidently it was a bit shy so we could not get close for the most
precise view, but until told differently, we assume it was one. It is the
cooler story after all.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_155919.webp' description='View from at or very near the top. This is the other side, not the side we went up by.' %}

We got to the top eventually at 2050m. There was a couple sitting there
enjoying the view. I overheard them and they were Belgian. Figures that you
travel halfway across Europe and up a mountain only to find compatriots. I
ignored them entirely, of course. We too enjoyed the views, took some pictures,
had a snack, and finally prepared to get back down. I had an easier time
bombing down than going up, so I just went at comfortable-for-me pace and
waited from time to time for the girlfriend and her sister who took a more
careful approach. The entire walked ended up totalling just 6.3 km, but took us
2h15 of moving (3h52 with all the breaks).

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_161837.webp' description='The little trail is the start of the way back down. We went down another path than the one we took going up.' %}
{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210728_163900.webp' description='Just bombed down this side. Looking back at the girlfriend and her sister taking a slower and safer approach.' %}

{% include location.html lat=46.27249 lon=13.98188 description="Penzion Resje restaurant." %}

Afterwards we went for dinner in Penzion Resje, having some more local cuisine,
and a local beer (Polesnjak by Lintvern brewery). I probably should have taken
note of _what_ we ate to make this paragraph more useful, but here we are. The
server was really nice so if you ever pass by there, I hope you have the same
service! We were eating outside and near the end of the meal it started
thunderstorming and pouring down. Good timing. The drive back to the airbnb was
an interesting one: paying attention in the darkness combined with rain to
ensure we safely got back, but the lightning views were pretty amazing.

## Day 4: Three Country Point and a boo-boo

Before this night I had mentioned that my body needed more rest and this one
proved it. I slept in a bit. By the time I got up (9:25ish), I still felt very
tired, and also a little grumpy about that too. But the morning was wasting
away and I said I could postpone my run till later in the day, whenever and
wherever we could fit it in. I figured we wanted to get the day's hike started
sooner rather than later.

{% include location.html lat=46.5229856 lon=13.7140622 description="Three country point of Slovenia, Italy, and Austria." %}

We drove to the north west corner of Slovenia, to the village of Rateče. From
there, we climbed upwards to mount Peč aka Monte Forno aka Ofen, the three
country point of Slovenia, Italy, and Austria. Coming from the Slovenian side
there are two main ways to reach it, though you do not have to make that choice
until you are a few km into the walk. The first option is the one we took going
up and it is exclusively for walking. It is a series of, if I recall correctly,
30 switchbacks in a forest, constantly climbing upwards. A countdown for the
switchbacks is painted on the trees, so at every turn, you know how many more
you have to go. The second option is a wide gravel path that I think you can
technically drive up, though I don't recall much parking space to speak of at
the top. It is also the way you would take when biking up and down. We took
this way down to make it a bit easier on ourselves.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210729_132114.webp' description='The switchback countdown painted on the trees. Motivating or the opposite?' %}

At the top is a border marker stone, some monuments aimed at promoting the
friendship between the countries, and mementos of how the border used to be.
The Austrian side also gives you a magnificent view on a big valley. Walk a bit
further east from the border marker, staying on the Austrian side, and you will
find two cafés/restaurants and a cable cart taking you up and down to the
village of Arnoldstein. We hung around a bit at the top, had a drink and a bite
in one of the two places, and eventually made our way back down the easier of
the two Slovenian options.

With the newfound knowledge of what border marker stones look like, we suddenly
spotted quite a few of them indicating the Slovenian-Italian border. A sizeable
portion of the path is right next to the border so you can spot them between
the trees a few meters in.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210729_134831.webp' description='View from the top, looking towards the Austrian side. The little building there has a restaurant and the cable cart connection taking you down the Austrian side.' %}
{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210729_155540.webp' description='One of the views on the way back down. If I recall there was a sign there with which mountain in the view is which. I have, of course, completely forgotten this information.' %}

{% include location.html lat=46.49252 lon=13.73752 description="Zelenci natural reserve, its main observation point." %}

By the time we got back down (13 km total, nearly 4 hrs), most of the day was
already behind us. We did a quick stop at the Zelenci natural reserve. From
their parking lot it is only a 400-500 metre flat walk to the main spot of this
reserve. This made it a bit disappointing as it was overcrowded with instagram
girls and people with no respect for nature. We quickly continued on to Lake
Jasna, where I would get my run (again 13 km) in while the girlfriend and her
sister would walk around a little. The run was... not ideal.

{% include location.html lat=46.47437 lon=13.78376 description="Lake Jasna" %}

I quickly felt a rather strong need to poop (TMI? Suck it up, this is my blog), luckily getting to a toilet
eventually. Then I had done all the roads at the lake, and running around the
lake was not an option: it was tiny and there were too many people. Instead I
went up into the mountains. This went OK for a while, the path was a wide
packed gravel path that could probably fit a car or two. Easy peasy. Figures
that on that exact path I manage to twist my left ankle while still being a
while away from where we had parked the car. The ankle was not painful going
upwards, but it was hell when running back down. I had to be real careful with
it and was glad when I finally reached the car. The section where I twisted my
ankle was basically flat and, as mentioned before, not very difficult terrain.
Perhaps the tiredness was catching up to me in terms of not paying enough
attention (I believe it was a small rock that caused the twisting) and the body being
tired leading to easier injury.

We were going straight to another restaurant from here, so I still needed to
clean myself. Third lake in a row, here I come! Sadly for me, the sun had set
behind the mountains by now and the lake was _cold_. _Really_ cold. I dipped my toe in and
wanted to nope out of that. Eventually I braced myself and jumped in. The
pressure change did not feel good on the ankle, but what was worse was the
cold.  You know that description people give of little daggers stabbing you all
over your body? I found out that that is pretty accurate. I quickly grabbed the
ladder to get back out and onto the little pier so I could dry myself. Clean
enough!

{% include location.html lat=46.36854 lon=14.03530 description="Gostilna Zatrnik restaurant" %}

We drove quite a ways back to our neck of the woods and stopped at a little
restaurant (Gostilna Zatrnik) on the way from Krnica and our village. We
arrived there rather late, but luckily were still allowed to order food. I got
a bear stew (cause how often can you say you've had bear), which if I recall
just seemed like the Belgian stoofvlees dish to me. There was also a big fluffy
dog walking around who clearly knew what he could expect from the guests, he
quickly came begging for some scraps. He got some in the end, thus perpetuating
the begging cycle.

When driving back to Koprivnik after our meal, we noticed how clear the sky
was.  This was the first night where this was the case, so we looked for a good
spot and parked on the side of the road to look at the night sky. Compared to
Brussels, the view was magnificent, reminiscent of our trip in the Mojave
Desert. You could easily see the Milky Way, enough stars to make me confused
about which constellations I was looking at, and near the horizon we also
spotted a bright blob that I later figured out was probably Jupiter. I wish
there wasn't so much light pollution in Belgium, some more
stargazing would be nice.

## Day 5: Cannot Move Much

It was pretty clear from the moment that I got out of bed that I would not be
running or doing crazy walks today. The left ankle I had twisted the day before
was still pretty painful, especially when put into weirder positions. I might
have been able to put it through a gentle run, but I decided to be responsible
and not push my luck.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210730_095957.webp' description='The viewpoint at the edge of the village, but now more zoomed in on the lake in the middle of the day 1 picture.' %}

We did a brief (and for me: careful) walk to the viewpoint at the edge of the
village (remember the run on the first day?). By noonish we had done some shopping in a supermarket in Bohinjska
Bistrica. Next we went west a little to park the car just outside of Ribčev Laz
and walked into and past the village to get to... Lake Bohinj again. I had said
how chilling in this lake after my run had been one of the nicest and calmest
moments of the trip for me so far. The girlfriend combined this knowledge with
the fact that I had said all the hiking was not fun any more because it was
just too endlessly intense. I like _some_ chilling on my vacations and we had
had none of that. Thus an afternoon at the beach of the lake. It all felt a bit
forced to me. I also thought the girlfriend and her sister would ditch me
immediately for a walk. So all in all I was not looking forward to it much. Add
to that a veritable mass of other people being out to enjoy the beach. Meh.
After an hour or two I finally chilled out some. Afterwards we went to a bar
nearby (Karakter Bar), had some drinks (two more from Lintvern brewery: Black
IPA and Bohinjski Čatež), played some card game (Go Sushi or something?), and
stuck around long enough to eventually have dinner there too.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210730_150742.webp' description='A slightly more quiet part of beach around Lake Bohinj.' %}

After dinner we went back home and I got very tired and moody again. Maybe I
was just exhausted: as soon as we were back at the airbnb (_maybe_ 21:00,
likely earlier), I just dropped in bed, ded.

## Day 6: T-storms and another Gorge

The ankle felt good enough to run in the morning and we were taking the morning
easier than usual too (earlier complaining about the busy schedule having some
effects?), so I could just have a go immediately without holding up any plans.
I figured I would do 10 km max, to not overwork the ankle. I also figured I
should not go too far so that I could easily walk back if necessary. Running
felt fine, the ankle was holding up, and I figured I could do the full 10 km.
About 5.5 km in, it started raining _hard_. Thunder and lightning followed
quickly. As soon as I had felt it starting to pour, I had gone into the nearest
shed. I figured it would blow over soon and I could be on my way.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210731_094852.webp' description='Clouds moving in. Maybe someone with more experience would have recognised this as a «hmm I should head back» moment.' %}

"Soon" ended up being around 25 minutes of constant thunders. With the lay of
the land between me and the airbnb (only about 1 km but a wide open field), I
was not going to risk anything and just stood around. Eventually it cleared up
some and I made a beeline home. I might have kept running nearby but I had lost
the mood after all the standing around and was somewhat worried about being
caught in a new stormfront. Just 6.5 km in the end. Bummer but oh well.

{% include location.html lat=46.3298 lon=13.8762 description="Mostnica waterfall at the end of the Mostnica gorge area." %}

Afterwards we went for a walk north of Stara Fužina, along the Mostnica gorge.
Not too much elevation and not very technical, which was probably the way to go
for my ankle. Pretty enough to look at, without being that much effort. At the
halfway point we stopped for some lunch (for me anyway) at a little
restaurant/café (Planinski Dom {% include location.html lat=46.31012
lon=13.88258 description="Planinski Dom restaurant." %}).  I got some sort of
stew/barley wheat soup with sausage and bread. I believe the correct Slovenian
name is Ričet. A proper hearty meal, I'm a fan. With the lunch downed, we
continued further north to the Mostnica waterfall (Slap Mostnica). It looked
more impressive than the Slap Šum waterfall from day 2, but that was not a tall
bar to clear. We took some pictures and walked back. Ended up being nearly 10
km of walking, but pretty easy compared to other days.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/202107-slovenia/20210731_135804.webp' description='Local fauna in Mostnica gorge.' %}

We had a relatively early dinner at a restaurant & pizzeria ({% include
location.html lat=46.26795 lon=13.90982 description="Pr’ Pristavc Gostlina in
Pizzerija." %}).  I think I had another stew-y dish and half of the
girlfriend's pizza. It was OK, but the lunch stew had been better. Also got a
beer (Villacher Dunkel), but that was a bit disappointingly flat. Either way,
we decided to make it an early night back to the Airbnb and made it home before
20:00. Earliest night so far. Ended up chilling on our balcony: nice mountain
views and some beers I had bought earlier in the week. Might be the first day
that I truly felt was a relaxing day. Figures that we'd be heading home the
next day.

## Day 7: Ljubljana

{% include location.html lat=46.33511 lon=13.96948 description="Peat bog at Goreljek." %}

My body decided to wake up much earlier than all previous days (6ish?), so I
downed some food and went for my run. Shocker, I know. I decided on about 13
km, I was still a little bit weary about the ankle so did not want to throw my
long run at it. I had already given up on this week anyway in terms of good
running. Hope the hiking compensated a little bit for the missed running. I ran
up nearly 300m to reach the next village over, which was much too steep to be
pleasant running. Then I ran around a peat bog up there and some more loops in
the area to get my distance up (this area was somewhat flat). Afterwards I
bombed back down the climb. No crazy forest attempts today like on day one, I
did not want to be too late for checkout accidentally.

We checked out of the Airbnb and drove to Ljubljana. Planned for the day: some
chilling and sightseeing while waiting for our plane, which would not depart
till pretty late in the evening. We did some walking around the city centre,
spotting a bridge with dragon statues. The city seemed big on dragon symbols.
We had some lunch and then walked up the hill to the castle. We looked around
and chilled a bit up there, before taking the long way back down. On that long
way, we got caught in a downpour and hid under a bridge for a while for it to
stop. The Airbnb had given us some homemade liquor at checkout, so we had a
little hobo picnic under that bridge. When the rain stopped, we walked on, and
came across some international beach volleyball tournament that was happening
on one of the squares. We looked on for a set, but did not care _that_ much
either, so we continued on. Saw some more things, found a place for dinner and
a drink. We took our time with that because the plane was likely to be delayed.
Afterwards we got an ice cream from a pretty fancy place with some exotic
sounding selections. If you are ever in Ljubljana, you might as well check
them out. They're called "Cacao" ({% include location.html lat=46.0515768
lon=14.5071166 description="Cacao ice cream parlor." %}) and are located in the
centre, near the Tromostovje bridge across the Ljubljanica river. After all that, we
made our way back to the car (totalled about 9 km of walking around Ljubljana)
and from there to the airport. Had to wait quite a while for our much delayed
plane, but in the end we got back home safe and sound.

Parting note: the entire week I finished maybe 2 streets in Citystrides (see
[Heatmap Goals][heatmapgoals]), mostly because roads in tiny villages in
Slovenia do not get a name, a house just has _village name, number_ as address.
The walking around Ljubljana finished about 25, because streets did have names
there.

Parting parting note: If you want more detail on parts of this trip in order to
plan your own, feel free to shoot me a message.

Parting parting parting note: As you perhaps can tell, the photos are
compressed down a bunch to save bandwidth. If you want any in better quality, I
do still have the originals.
