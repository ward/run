TODO? Seems out of place as a blog post? Perhaps I need a kb of sorts... Maybe
merge with books section. Need to add server redirects in that case though.

Critical velocity (CV) in running is defined by Tom 'Tinman' Schwartz (Citation
needed? He does seem to have popularised it at least). It is a pace you can
race for 30 minutes. Tinman calls it "somewhat hard". Comparing it to some Jack
Daniels paces, it would be faster than **T**hreshold (hour race pace), but
slower than **I**ntervals (~VO2max, 12ish minutes race pace). See it as yet
another pace you can decide to train at. Tinman says it is helpful from 800m to
definitely 10 km, he argues it goes all the way to the marathon though.

## What Does It Improve

Improves aerobic capacity of Type IIA muscle fibers. These fibers can be
specialised to be more aerobic or more anaerobic, depending on what training
you throw at them. CV makes them "consumers of oxygen and producers of power".
Helps with sustaining pace for 800m and more races. Tinman argues it helps all
the way up to marathons.

The muscle improvements lead to the following two noticeable effects. First, it
elevates the average cruising speed during races. Cruising for long without
increasing fatigue. Second, it improves from how far from the finish line you
can start your kick. The length you can sustain the kick.

## Finding Your CV Pace

You could go out for a fully rested 30 minute race effort, but that is probably
harder to plan in. You probably have somewhat of an idea of the range to go
for, but if you want more precise numbers, Tinman provides an [online
calculator][tinmancalculator]. Just enter any recent or representative race
time. Others[^Pettitt2016][^sou68] have suggested doing a 3 minute all out run.
That is, after a sufficient warmup, you start running all out from the start.
You just keep going as hard as you can for 3 minutes. Your pace will flatten
out somewhat eventually. The pace in the last 30 seconds is your critical
velocity. This last method is useful if you do not have race efforts to go
by.

You could also try by feel, of course, though that may prove much trickier. As
mentioned in the intro, Tinman describes it as 'somewhat hard'. I have heard it
also described as being right between comfortably hard (a description often
attributed to the 1 hour race pace, **T** pace in Daniels speak) and on the
edge. In that context a VO2max workout (**I** pace, ~11 minute race pace) feels
like "a little to a lot under the edge".[^runinxs-artc-training-slack]

## How to Train at CV Pace

The eventual goal seems to be repetitions of around 2 to 5 minutes with
recovery lasting about one third of the repetition's duration. The maximum
total duration at CV pace would be around 25 minutes (as mentioned in a video
of tinamn). From what I have heard, us average runners may be happier at 20
minutes maximum. Another more precise number I have heard, but one for which I
did not look for a proper source, is dividing 420 by your 5 km time in minutes.
This gives you maximum time at CV, also in minutes.

Getting to this eventual point may take you several sessions though. Start out
with longer recoveries or shorter repetitions. Post workout recovery is about
2-3 days.  Add a few extra recovery days in case a race follows.

You can do CV workouts year round. There is no specific CV phase in your
build-up. Limit yourself to one a week or one every other week.

### An Example

As an example, planning and analysing my first CV session went as follows. To
make up a workout, I just picked a duration on the lower end of the 2 to 5
minutes range, considered my CV pace, and picked a distance that fit with
things. In my case, [Tinman's calculator][tinmancalculator] put my 800m time in
a CV training at the 2:5x neighbourhood. Under 3 minutes seems like a safe
place to start. Finding a distance to aim at will make it easier to do this
correctly on a track. I like the precision versus GPS. I started with just 4
reps, and used a recovery of ~1:30 rather than the ~1:00 you would expect in
the ideal situation (i.e., a third of just shy of 3 minutes). In my case, this
workout felt a bit too easy, though of course a first workout is to get used to
things. Your mileage may vary.

How to improve from here to the theoretical maximum is pretty obvious, there
are not a whole lot of variables to play with. Either increase the repetitions,
increase the repetition duration, or decrease the rest. In all three cases, you
evidently do not want to cross the maxima mentioned above (maximum 25 minutes
total, maximum 5 minutes per rep, minimum a third of duration recovery). I will
likely bump my next CV workout up to 6Ã—800 next time with a little shorter
rest.

As always, if it takes you too long to recover in the days following a workout,
then you probably overdid it.

incorporated.

- Letsrun has (at least) two articles about/with Tinman and CV.
- There are some scientific papers

I did not come up with anything in this blog post, I am just combining
information from various other sources. Give them a read to ensure I correctly
