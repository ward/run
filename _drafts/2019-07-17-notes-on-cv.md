Critical velocity (CV) in running is defined by Tom 'Tinman' Schwartz (Citation
needed? He does seem to have popularised it at least). It is a pace you can
race for 30 minutes. Tinman calls it "somewhat hard". Comparing it to some Jack
Daniels paces, it would be faster than **T**hreshold (hour race pace), but
slower than **I**ntervals (~VO2max, 12ish minutes race pace). See it as yet
another pace you can decide to train at. Tinman says it is helpful from 800m to
definitely 10 km, he argues it goes all the way to the marathon though.

## What Does It Improve

Improves aerobic capacity of Type IIA muscle fibers. These fibers can be
specialised to be more aerobic or more anaerobic, depending on what training
you throw at them. CV makes them "consumers of oxygen and producers of power".
Helps with sustaining pace for 800m and more races. Tinman argues it helps all
the way up to marathons.

The muscle improvements lead to the following two noticeable effects. First, it
elevates the average cruising speed during races. Cruising for long without
increasing fatigue. Second, it improves from how far from the finish line you
can start your kick. The length you can sustain the kick.

## Finding Your CV Pace

You could go out for a fully rested 30 minute race effort, but that is probably
harder to plan in. You probably have somewhat of an idea of the range to go
for, but if you want more precise numbers, Tinman provides an [online
calculator][tinmancalculator]. Just enter any recent or representative race
time. Others[^Pettitt2016][^sou68] have suggested doing a 3 minute all out run.
That is, after a sufficient warmup, you start running all out from the start.
You just keep going as hard as you can for 3 minutes. Your pace will flatten
out somewhat eventually. The pace in the last 30 seconds is your critical
velocity. This last method is useful if you do not have race efforts to go
by.

## How to Train at CV Pace

The eventual goal seems to be repetitions of around 2 to 5 minutes with
recovery lasting about one third of the repetition's duration. Max out the
total duration at around 25 minutes (TODO: This was of the workout parts I
assume? Or also the rest?). Getting to this eventual point may take you several
sessions though.  Start out with longer recoveries or shorter repetitions.
Post workout recovery is about 2-3 days. Add a few days in case a race follows.

You can do CV workouts year round. There is no specific CV phase in your
build-up. Limit yourself to one a week or one every other week.

I did not come up with anything in this blog post, I am just combining
information from various other sources. Give them a read to ensure I correctly
distilled information.
