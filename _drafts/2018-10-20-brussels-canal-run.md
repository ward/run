## Getting There

## Race

* 13k started first, bunch of people slow on the uptake of staggered start
* 9k next, 4k last
* Line up first row because expecting at least top 10
* Talk with a guy with bright yellow shoes at the start. He asks if it's two
  loops, I tell him the course changed and it's one long one for us.
* Start follow the first group a bit to see what they're at.
* 3:20s. Nop out of that and let them go
* Do a head count: I am in 10th position. Yellow shoes is in the first group I
  just let go
* Guess I am pacing myself again
* In first km already start passing people from the 13k (remember: some late
  starters too). Tons of room
* About 1.5k in, narrows to the path along the canal. Lots and lots of weaving
  from here on out
* ~2.5k in, notice yellow shoes ahead of me
* Notice I start to slowly get closer to him
* Catch up to him 100-200m before 4k, bit before we turn left over the canal
* Say hi and such
* Go in front of him right before the turn, dont look back any more. Now in 9th
  position, unless I missed people.
* Cobbles suck
* Stairs suck. Saw we were reaching them so quickly hurried in front of one 13k
  guy and reached it together with another 13k guy. Thankfully he made enough
  room by holding right, letting me pass
* Pass Tina, moose it up, think maybe I'm going too easy if I can just be silly
* π turns suck. A slower guy was on the inside of the turn. Ended up slowing
  almost to a halt, restarting sucks.
* Advantage of π turns: I can look at the people behind me. Saw yellow shoes,
  50-100m behind me. However, also saw another guy with a yellow bib. Guess I
  am in 8th position instead of 10th now, since I vaguely recall passing the
  guy a bit earlier and nobody has passed me since letting the first group go.
* Did my usual point-at-water-giver. He started jogging backwards for me so I
  could more easily grab the cup. Poured it over head
* They closed off more of the street on the next part compared to two years
  ago, so passing people, while still annoying, was not _as_ annoying.
* Notice heart rate is relatively low for a race of this distance (171ish,
  while I should probably have high 170s at least), start speeding up to ~3:30s
  with 1k to go. Goes easily enough. Oops. Not dead enough.
* Finish, feeling alright enough. Drink water bottle they gave us (0.5l) and a
  huge apple. Wait for Reinout, walk to bag drop with him, dump my goodie bag
  with my earlier bag. Go for a cooldown that feels alright. (Was slightly
  worried about the water/apple).
