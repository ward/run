Just catching up on the past summer months with some highs and lows, PRs and
recurring little injuries, training a bit all over the place, but mostly in the
"not enough actual workouts" camp. I will just go through it chronologically.
There is one road race, one track relay (provincial) championship race, and two
individual track races.

## After the Brussels 20 km

I felt great after a [successful 20 km door Brussel][bxl20k]. Had two weeks of
easy running, though not specifically low in volume after the first week. Then
halfway the third week, I got COVID19. So that made me skip several days before
carefully restarting. Maybe a week after restarting though, I took a weird step
when walking around the office and had a big stab of pain in my left hip. I
feel old writing that out. It is the same hip that bothered me earlier in the
year and I think it was the same injury coming back somehow. I took another few
days off before restarting more cautiously than I did after COVID. I got back
into it over a week or two, three, skipping a day because of travel. The
running was kept easy, while I got the volume back relatively quickly. By this
point it was already July, it was hot and humid, and I was in hillier terrain.
The hip was likely fine already, but I kept it as a sort of excuse to not have
to run hard in terrible weather. Fine or not, bad weather or not, I decided to
hop in a local race to stretch the legs and get some racing feel again.

Weeks overview:

- 87 km, post 20 km week [May-June]
- 113 km, no workouts
- 64 km, a workout, some strides, then got COVID and stopped
- 68 km, coming back from COVID
- 62 km, easy running, hip acts up [June-July]
- 69 km, easy running post hip niggle
- 85 km, easy running and a travel day
- 111 km, hot, humid, hilly, but easy beyond that

## Local Road Race with a Chance of First Place

The CCRS Tuesday Ice Cream in the Park 5k series caught my eye. The two
previous races of the series had a winner that seemed easy enough to beat,
though I wondered whether a college athlete on their summer break might show up
and smoke the field. TT or racing, I was up for some action and signed up.

The race was on a Tuesday evening, around 19:00, which helped a little with the
weather. You mostly did not have direct sunlight any more due to it being low
enough and the trees on the course blocked it because of that. It was still
warm, it was still humid. Before the start you got a ticket for the post race
raffle which I passed on to my wife just in case we were still there when that
occurred.

I went for a little jog, stretched a bit near what I supposed was the start
line, cheered a little at the kids' race, and observed other people getting
ready for our race, scoping out the competition. And then I spotted what looked
like a fast guy. Lean figure, wirey legs. I figured looks could be deceiving
though. Then he started another little jog and the stride just looked really
smooth. He definitely looked faster than me. I figured I would just try to
follow him any way though, see what happens. With the lack of fast running due
to COVID and the hip, I did not know what to expect, but I also did not
particularly mind blowing up.

It was time to line up and he and I were the only two lining up at front. It
was a small path, but a third or fourth person could have easily joined in
still though. Nop, just us. Off we went, slightly trading places before I
quickly settled in behind him. I also quickly felt this was going to be tricky. After 700-800 metre, my GPS said we were going 3:10 per km pace.

That's a moutful. Came with the intention of winning after seeing the previous 2 of this 4 series race were won in the higher 17s. Should be easy enough, right?

Copy paste from quick ARTC slack race report:

Mini race report. Yday's 5k was fun enough. Before the start I saw one guy that just looked way faster, both his more wirey legs physique and his warmup just looked smooth. Figured I'd just follow him at the start and see. 700-800m in GPS gave like 3:10 as pace aka a bit too fast. Blew up a bit when there was a bump to reach a bridge. Was a bit out of it for the next km or so and by the end of that I heard third place catch up to me. When he did I just focused on beating him. We traded places a few times, surging (in sofar as it was possible) and such to get rid of the other. He usually on very slight bumps upwards, me then right after on downwards. Some uneven grassy uphill section was the worst for that. Eventually he cracked with less than a km to go, but I couldn't tell how far behind he was so just kept up that effort. Kinda meh 17:47 for second place, the winner just cruised to the finish after he dropped me cause he ran 17 in the end. Told me afterwards he had already done a workout that morning (race was at 19:00), so ye. Weirdly enough that didn't place me 2nd overall but instead first age group (only first overall got overall placing).

There was a raffle after and I was drawn first, got Mizuno shoes from it (still have to pick them up at their store).

Guy that won the previous two in May and June was third overall.
