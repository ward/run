imnotwadegreeley  A good starter workout or two would be 8x2 mins working to 12x2 mins CV with 1 min rest, then you can transition into 3 minute reps with 1/3 rest and up to KM reps or 4-5 min reps even. CV reps will feel tough, especially in the second half of the workout but not as bad as 5k work.
To make the workout even better I generally do 8 strides as part of the warm up and then will do 6-8 x 30s hill sprints or 30s @ mile pace to finish off, works on speed and efficient form while your legs are tired
Theoretical max CV time is 420/5k time, ie if your 5k is 17 mins you work up to 24 mins
But I rarely am hitting the max in my workouts as that is a huge amount.

ogfirenation:ghost:  50% rest might seem excessive, but if you think about it, it fits perfectly with the tinman idea of keeping the ball rolling. CV workouts aren't meant for you to be lighting the barn on fire. They're supposed to be challenging at the end, but not hard. For most of us, we're not at a fitness level where adding 20 or 30 seconds of jogging is detrimental, but reducing it by that much can be
And also, CV is generally used at the beginning of a cycle for marathon prepped, so you don't need to be worried about peaking just yet IMO

imnotwadegreeley  Just for my progression as one data point, my CV workouts have been:
1) 8x2 mins with 1 min jog
2) 10 strides, 4x1km with 1 min jog, 4x30s at mile pace
3) 10x2 mins with 1 min jog
4) 12x2 mins with 1 min jog
5) 8x3 mins with 1 min jog, 8 strides, 4x30s hill sprints
6) 8 strides, 7x1km with 1 min jog, 7 x 30s hill sprints
7) 8 strides, 7x1km with 1 min jog, 8x30s at mile
That's with other workouts mixed in as well, doing one CV workout approximately every two weeks since June. Next one I am planning on doing 8x1km
It initially felt quite tough with the two minute reps, but now the 1kms dont even feel too bad
