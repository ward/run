Looking for something different in my spring planning, I checked out some of
the bigger flat options in the area.  For the first time, I gave the 10 mile in
Antwerp a serious look. It is an odd distance in most of the world.  Checking
[Tinman's running calculator][tinman] with some of my race times placed me
around the low 6Xs for most of my PRs.  My [parkrun in
November][parkrunvictoria] however gave me a time of 59 high. Straw, prepare to
be grasped at. I had a race and a crazy goal to aim for.

## Course Details

The first 2 km are pretty much flat. After that you turn onto a highway, which means climbing up the ramp.
After that first climb you get a brief respite as you descend into a tunnel under the Schelde river.
Of course, that also means climbing back out of it. After emerging on the other side of the river, you take the ramp off the highway. This one sends you
through another quick tunnel.
Pretty much flat. Four turns that are too sharp. Two tunnels totalling two to
three kilometre. Probably some cobble sections (TODO: Update afterwards)

## Training


## Goals and Strategy

The race was going to have a one hour pacer. As I had set the stretch goal, I
figured I would just follow him for as long as I could. Hopefully till the end.
