I have [previously talked about my heatmap goals][heatmapgoals]. With 2021
behind us, I felt like giving an update and writing out what I see
myself focusing on in 2022.

## Brussels Update

_Situation at the end of the year. Things slightly changed again by the time I
got this post out._

| Vorst                | 44 %     | +42 % | 201           |
| Watermaal-Bosvoorde  | 98 %     | +87 % | 259           |
| ==================== | ======== | ===== | ============= |
| **Total**            | **76 %** | +38 % | **4986**      |

The above table compares numbers to the previous blog post back in May. In
terms of the ranking on CityStrides, I went up to the second spot in Brussels.
First place was around 84% last I checked. I am still behind, but slowly
closing in.

I used good weather days to get parts of the far side of Brussels done. Calm
bike ride over, do a run, bike back. It is quite nice when not too cold and
with some sun out. Sadly that is not possible on workdays, it just takes too
much time. Big focus of that approach was Ukkel.

In October I briefly started going to the office again. I switched all my work
day running to be lunch time runs in that area. This enabled me to focus on
Etterbeek, Elsene, and Watermaal-Bosvoorde. Alas, work from home laws came back
into effect following yet another COVID-19 surge and that approach was largely
put back on hold.

I have made a video showing the progress on Brussels streets in 2021. The first
view is prior to any 2021 running, every change is another month of progress.

## Cross Belgium

From the previous post:

That indeed ended up happening, meaning very little progress was made since
then. Specifically, I only 'worked' on this one twice. One time, I felt
motivated to take the train out to Wetteren and ran from there back to my
tendril in Aalst. That is about halfway to Gent, so now I should be able to
make that connection more easily. The other time, I happened to be in Knokke
for a coastal weekend with a friend. I took the opportunity to run to the
Belgian-Dutch border and a bit in the Knokke area. Not a lot of progress, but
touching the border there already feels like a nice achievement and will look
nice later on.

## Run the Coast

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/20220123.heatmap-update.coast.webp' description='The 70-75 km of Belgian coast. A trip to the south-west side is in order.' %}

This plan had already formed before the trip to Knokke mentioned in the
previous section, but that Knokke trip solidified it: I want to run across the
entire Belgian coast. If you are unfamiliar with the Belgian coast, that might
sound like a lofty goal. Trust me though, it is not. It is only around 70-75 km
of running total and pretty well serviced by public transport. It is really
just a matter of heading over to that side of Belgium.

Thus, when I was in Knokke, after making the Belgian-Dutch border connection, I
spent another morning taking the tram out so I could run back to where we were
staying. With barely any running, I now already have a little more than a third
of the coast complete.

## The Blob

Not much conscious effort has been put into this. I largely just run and try to
get some new streets whenever possible. That said, sometimes I do go out of my
way for a "folieke" just because it looks nice on the map or because I am in a
mood.

{% include image.html domain=site.baseurl url='/assets/img/20220123.heatmap-update.blob.webp' description='Current blob situation, with some tendrils cut off.' %}

During the year I got some heatmapping done in Mechelen and Tervuren. They are
both a bit out of the way, but it is tempting to connect them to the blob. I
would also like to connect Opwijk to Affligem (in the north-west) and Dworp to
Waterloo (in the south). Beyond that, nothing particular comes to mind.

## Pennsylvania

The USA border had long been closed to me because of COVID-19 regulations. With
the recent reopening I was finally allowed back in, and I ended up heading once
more into the Philadelphia suburbs to visit the girlfriend's family. Back in
2015 we had done some minor heatmapping effort, but that had quickly sizzled
back out (just like most my heatmapping had) and since then most of the running
had been done along the Chester Valley Trail or in the Valley Forge area.
Always the same few routes.

This time around, I arrived with a newfound motivation. Having taken it so
seriously in Brussels, it was easy to continue the habit there. Easy to
motivate myself anyway. Suburbia USA has one big problem: they seem to hate
pedestrians with a vengeance. You have your own little neighbourhood (a dead
end of a few streets) and to get to another one you have to run on deathly
roads with high speed limits, a car lane each way, and everyone else can get
fucked. Getting anywhere without a car can get rather dangerous. The safest way
to get streets done is to drive to a neighbourhood, park there, run the
neighbourhood, and go to another one. Not very pleasant.

This is a bit of a drag, especially with our car situation while there.
Instead, I decided to not focus too much on the actual street count and tried
to connect up the different bits of heatmap I had. Sound familiar? We're
creating another blob, ladies and gentlemen! One downside: them dangerous
streets. I had made up my mind though, I had packed my fluorescent running vest
before heading state side and I figured I would give it an honest try.

It actually went better than expected. I think I was helped by doing it around
Christmas-New Year. Perhaps also due to more people working from home or
picking the right hours (i.e., _not_ during rush hour or lunch time). Whatever
the reason, it was not as busy as I remembered it being the past years. Most
streets I could handle fine with the tiny bit of shoulder that was given to me
and the patches of grass I could hop onto if necessary. Several places were not
as forgiving, but I did my best to tackle those as defensively as possible:
always wait for the cars to do their things, try to wait it out so you do not
see a car coming in the distance, run the dangerous part with a certain urgency
(no all out sprint to ensure full focus). For some, I also managed to convince
the girlfriend to drop me off in one spot, have her drive to a place where
walking is nice, and just have her go for a walk there while waiting for me to
run over. That helped _a lot_, good thing we are all so used to having to drive
to get any safe running done in this area.

When I was in a situation where I could not connect any parts on that day, I
instead decided to risk other brief moments of danger to reach other nearby
neighbourhoods and do some good ol' street hunting.

## Plans For 2022

- **Brussels**. Finish it up. The order of the communes does not matter much,
  but I will probably try ticking them off one-by-one to have small
  achievements along the way.
- **Brussels, bis**. Do an extra sweep for streets marked complete on CS but
  not actually complete. Think streets where you have run by both ends, but not
  through it. This can often mark it as complete in CS, due to CS only taking
  nodes of a way into account. I.e., the node on either end.
- **Cross Belgium**. This will continue being "when inspired". Travelwise it is
  a bit of a drag, especially the (longer) south side of Belgium.
- **Run the Coast**. I will not go out of my way to do any of this. That said,
  in the off case that we decide to head to the coast for a weekend, I will
  suggest going to an area I have not yet completed. Might as well.
- **Blob**. Not a specific focus, but I am sure I will sometimes just feel like
  biking to the edges and do a random long run. Some desire to connect to
  Mechelen and to Tervuren, as well as making Opwijk-Affligem and
  Dworp-Waterloo connections.
- **Pennsylvania**. We should be able to start heading over more regularly
  again, so I expect I will continue connecting parts and expanding the blob
  there. Mainly I want to connect my main blob to the Downingtown-Marsh Creek
  connection I have to the west of it. Due to dangerous roads I will probably
  have to do a big detour to achieve this, but I have a bit of a plan in my
  mind for that. Beyond that one, everything will always be heavily in function
  of time and car situation so I hesitate to state any further goals.
- **Other**. Brussels might not always be possible on the day. Perhaps I can
  work on one of the Flemish villages outside the Brussels border? Not sure yet
  which one though.  Might feel like splitting this up into two approaches. (1)
  a closer side where I could still run to on long runs, or take the bus to and
  run back home (2) a further side that requires biking, or similar, over,
  running there, and biking back home.
