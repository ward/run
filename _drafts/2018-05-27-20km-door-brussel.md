Here we are again. My third time competing in the 20 km door Brussel. In the
past I took part in the [2015][edition2015] and [2016][edition2016] editions.
After the 2016 edition I declared I would stop caring about it because it is so
stupidly crowded: up to 40,000 people sign up, starting across just six waves.
In 2017 I was abroad when it happened. This year however, I was half
considering doing it again.  Since 2016 ended in, in my opinion, failure, I
still had a score to settle. I was not sure I really cared enough though. Then
a co-worker started taunting and challenging me. He was set on breaking my PR
and becoming the best in our lab. Eventually I decided to commit and signed up,
six weeks before the race itself.

## Training

Have not actually done much specificity training for this one. Instead I will
just describe what I _have_ done the past months. Base building, largely.
Aiming to run 65 km per week, spread over six days, longer run on Sunday,
workouts if I think the body (should) feel up for it. Down weeks every fourth
week. Been doing it this way as I have noticed some trouble in the past in
getting safely past 70, so I have been giving my body time to catch up to
things.

The 65 km idea started in February and went OK then. Got some tempos in, some
few 100m sprints. Halfway through March I caught a fever right before having to
go to Italy for a conference.  I was forced to take several days off.  I went
to the conference while still on fever reducing meds and short on sleep. It was
a bit hard on the body, but I managed to get back to running.

In April my mind was turning towards the 20 km. I did a [test race on the 8th
of April][joggingdenbosrond], seven weeks before the race. It went pretty well,
despite keeping myself under control, I managed around 4:20 pace. Of course,
that one was flatter and, as it turns out, cooler temperature than the 20 km
would be. Regardless, that sealed it for me, and I signed up shortly after. The
rest of April went fine until the final week. My right knee had been bothering
me a bit. It was not painful, just noticeable. A rusty/creaky feeling. I
decided to take some days off, see if it changed anything. After a few days, it
was still similar and I just got back into running.

For the first two weeks of May, I decided to slightly up the distance I ran: 68
km and 70 km. Peaking of sorts (hah).  On top of that, the Wednesday of the
second week had a [sort of 31Ã—600m workout][12urenloop]. That one definitely
tired the body out.  I got through it though and squeezed out a progression
long run on the Sunday of that second week too.

The next (and final) two weeks would be easier, with the race on the Sunday of
the second week. The distance went down a little bit (60k and 50k planned),
though I still threw in a tempo on the Thursday of the first week. The first
week ended in a trip to Amsterdam, which did add some walking and biking. The
biking tired out the hip a little bit (left side especially), I think the
rental bike must have not been too great for it. The week of the race was
almost all recovery runs, except for Wednesday when I squeezed in a 500m sprint
for a little internet competition.

## Course Details

For a longer description, see the [2016 report][edition2016].

Some highlights:

- Decent net uphill in the first half
- Add on to that three tunnels
- Bit more downhill in the second half
- Easiness of second half negated by a 40m climb over 1 km starting neatly
  around 2.5 km from the finish

## Goals and Strategy

On a non-number level, I wanted to make sure my co-worker would not be the best
of the lab after this race. I was OK with him breaking my old PR, but I was set
on breaking it myself too and doing it better.

In actual numbers, my PR was at 1:30:40 from 2016 (2015 was 1:30:41, I paced
2016 terribly). His PR was 1:33:xx from 2016. I will admit I did not feel
terribly threatened (hubris?): I figured if he would break my old PR, it would
not be by much. He on the other hand _was_ saying his training had been better
than ever and that he felt more in shape than ever before.

At the very least I wanted to PR. Besides that I figured my body could handle a
1:27:30, which would hopefully be plenty to keep him away. I had a stretch goal
of 1:25 if I was feeling particularly good.

In the week of the race, two important things happened. First, the weather
prediction was terrible. The entire week was not that bad, but had plenty of
rain and thunderstorms. The Sunday prediction for the race, however, was around
24C at the start with not a cloud in the sky and a high of 29C. Not my kind of
temperature.
