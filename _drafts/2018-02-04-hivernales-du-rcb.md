Another stab at racing 10 kilometres. I did this one [two years ago][rcb2016]
and blew up _entirely_. This time around I figured I would pace myself better,
which mostly means not starting too quickly. Two years ago their course was
actually just above 9 km, but they have since rectified this to be 10 km. Or
at least as precise as Belgian standards allow.

## Training

Past weeks have been aimed at low 60 km per week, spread over six days. Two of
the days are recovery days, one should be a tempo, one a longer run. Sprinkle
some strides in there when I remember to. This did not always work out.
Especially the tempo parts, which is the first thing to get cut from the
schedule if other things go wrong. And some things definitely did go wrong. I
managed to roll both ankles in the span of about a week around new year. The
right one especially bothered me as it got swollen and hurt for a week. I had a
few days of sickness (snot, sore throat) about 12 days out from the race.
Besides these things training has been going alright. Low 60s/week seems to
have gotten manageable.

I planned this race to be at the end of a down week. That is, I aimed for about
45 km as week total. So since the Monday leading up to the race, I had run just
short of 35 km.

## Course Details

In comparison to two years ago, a small loop has been added in the final few
kilometre.  I have got some notes that I had written down before the race, but
I like this description that I saw on somebody's Strava activity, because it
does almost feel that way:

> How is it possible for a loop to be uphill the whole way round?!

As for my pre-race notes, this is what they said

- 1.5km flatish (1.5km)
- 1.3km up heavy (2.8km)
- 800m down heavy (3.6)
- 700m up gently (4.3)
- 600m flatish (4.9)
- 700m up moderate (5.6)
- 200m down heavy (5.8)
- 400m up moderate (6.2)
- 1.2km flat/down (7.4)
- 400m down heavy (7.8)
- 500m up heavy (8.3)
- 700m flatish (9)
- 1km down heavy (10)

The first 1.5 km is on streets, after that things are less maintained. You have
some parts that once were paved but have gotten a bit worse for wear, with
cracks and potholes. There are some parts where there are rocks in the ground
keeping the earth together, parts where a thin layer of slippery mud is on top
of that. By and large though it was quite runnable. It also had not been too
wet the days before so that may have helped.

I am writing this a week later after having spent the entire week working every
free hour of my day, so the memory has gotten a bit foggy on those details.

## Goals and Strategy

Do not blow up like last time! That was really my main concern. I figured if I
got through the first 3 km alive (i.e., past the first major hill), everything
would work out. Two years ago I went up that hill _way_ too fast and never
recovered from it. Time wise I figured something in the 40 to 42 minute range
should be doable.

## Race Day

The start was going to be at 10:30. I woke up at 7:30 so I had time to eat in
peace and get my body ready. A bit before 8:30 the girlfriend, who would be
taking pictures, and I were out the door to catch a metro at 8:30. We arrived
at the starting location a little around 9:30-9:35.

I went to pick up my bib and got told "the people from my group" had already
come to pick it up.  I was not part of any group, so I was a bit annoyed with
this. I got told to try their information booth to get it resolved.  Luckily,
there were no issues to fix it there. I got handed a new bib without questions
and it did not cause any problems in terms of my timing afterwards. Nobody
asked for any ID at any point here, which may have been part of the problem to
begin with. Oh well.

I had to go to the toilet and just like two years ago the line was huge. Wasted
a lot of time standing around there. By the time all that was done, I had about
10-15 minutes left till the start. Jogged down to the starting line, did some
strides, and squeezed in threeish rows from the start.

## Race

TODO

Start and stick behind the short blond woman I have seen at jaarmarktjogging. Figure she has better pacing than I do.
Switch to another female 500 metre or so further.
Some guy around my position is known by everyone of the road marking people.
All of them yell "Allez Marc" as we pass by.
Up the hill, he is dropped. Still with the one female. Some other guy passing me but does not get far, I pass him again on the downhill around the 3 km mark.
10k splits from the 20k race at 3.9-4k.
Next to an older guy for the next km.
Think I drop him at 5ish km.
Turn onto a street for 100 metre, then back onto the forest trail-y stuff for water stand.
Guy who had been 10s or so in front of me slows down a lot for that one and I pass him.
I just splash the water on me really. Drinking from cups is too hard.
Downwards to the edge of brussels and flanders, 7.5km in.
Turn back away from the edge, climbing.
A guy passes me as I have a difficult moment, I latch onto him.
Survive climbing behind him and with about 1.5 km to go things start to flatten out.
I speed up, drop him.
Last km is pretty much downhill, by then the guy is way behind already.
