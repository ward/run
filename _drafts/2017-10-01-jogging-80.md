As a little kid, I would sometimes run a bit with my father. Nothing serious.
He would take part in a race near where we lived and I took part in their kids'
race a few times. To feed my nostalgia, I decided to take part in it this year.
Besides two options for kids, they offer a 5km, 10km, 15km, and a 20km. I opted
for the 10 km.

## Training

Sickness!

## Course Details


## Goals and Strategy

Nothing special, just see how I feel and what I can do.
