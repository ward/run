I felt like updating my 10 km PR. The usual equivalence tables said it was my
softest time, meaning it should be an easy one to improve. I decided on
running one I ran back in November 2016: the [Natuurloopcriterium
Lier][lier2016]. This criterium holds a 10 km race (and some others) five times
in the winter months. More importantly: it is flat.

## Course Details

It is a flat course along the canals in the village of Lier. It is almost
entirely paved, besides some short grass patches, and a short part with weird
uneven rocks with gaps in-between them. There is no shade at the time of day of
the race, which was planned to start at 13:50. Not too many tight turns.
Pretty great really. Oh and the organisers decided to increase the length of
the course compared to last time I ran it. They were now calling it a *10.4 km
course*. Bleb ðŸ˜©

## Training

### Six Day Cycles

I had wanted to play around with a different length cycle than the usual seven
day cycle. The idea is to ensure having two recovery days in-between each
workout. In essence I was already having enough recovery days in the past, by
often planning just two workouts (i.e., a workout plus a long run) in my seven
day week. The idea was to use a nine or ten day cycle in order to have more
workouts, but still have two days of recovery (a rest day or an easy run)
in-between each run. In my mind, however, you have just one long run per *x*
day cycle, at the end of the cycle. I was not really in the mood to have fewer
long runs (one every seven days versus one every nine or ten days). Breaking
the entire idea down to three day blocks (recovery, recovery, workout), I
eventually decided to give six day cycles a try: recovery, recovery, workout,
recovery, recovery, long run. Not sure I have heard of people doing this yet,
but as long as I run enough with enough easy and enough hard, I figured I could
not do much wrong.

### The Plan

I went through eight six day cycles in the run up to the race. Right before the
first one, I also had a seven day one that I count as part of the decision to
run this race.  Thus, you could see it as nine cycles. By default, every cycle
had a long run on its last day.  The other workout was placed on the third day
of each cycle. Easy-easy-workout-easy-easy-long.  I will use Jack Daniels
terminology to say what the workout entailed.

The first three cycles had **R**eptition workouts: repeats of 200 or 400 metre
with equidistant rest. Pace is from JD tables, but might be around 1 km race
pace or faster? Not sure as I do not race those distances. The first two went
alright, I think I kinda like this short fast work. Reassuring since I have
been having half a mind of doing a training cycle focused on 1500 metre to 3000
metre.  Speaking of which, curious about the state my body was in, I replaced
the R workout of the third cycle with a mile time trial. Result: few seconds
slower than what I had in November, but I might just have been more tired now.
Did not taper for either.

For the next five cycles I wanted to alternate **T**hreshold (about 20-30
minutes around 1 hour race pace) and **I**ntervals (reps of 3-5 minutes at 3-5
km race pace, rest about half to 90% of the time). In other words T, I, T, I,
T. The first and second cycle felt alright. In the third one (a lower volume
cycle), my body felt too tired and I ended up dropping the T. Then for
scheduling I switched around the next two cycles.  Finally, I turned that last
I workout into a parkrun race. So the workouts of the five cycles ended up as
T, I, none, T, I-as-race.

Mini race report in race report: I ran 4-5 km to get to the parkrun start,
considered that my warmup.  From the start I first tried to keep up with the
first two guys. A few 100 metre in, when checking the pace, I noticed I had
forgotten to press start on the watch. Oops.  Little bit further, having
pressed start, I checked again, and noticed that the pace was going to be way
too much to hold for 5 km. Especially since we started up a hill.  I started
slowing, leaving three guys ahead of me. Soon after, another guy passed me
pushing me down to fifth position. One of the original three was also fading
though, probably having made the same mistake as I did. I passed him soon
after. It stayed like this for a bit as I was trying to find a pace that was
just easy enough to carry me to the end. The course consists of two loops and
the second time up the main hill of the course, the guy I had overtaken
earlier, went past me again. He quickly made a decent sized gap. I tried to
close it on the downhill, where I was faster, but did not manage. Eventually I
settled to just run home fifth spot. The final few 100 metre, a friend came
sprinting alongside me, which made me briefly go faster again. All in all it
went OK, time was 18:07. If I had known I would have been close to dipping
under 18 again (remember, forgot to start the watch), I probably would have
pushed a bit more the last km or so. Oh well.

The ninth cycle was a taper cycle. Reduced volume and a race pace test on
Tuesday with the race coming up on Saturday. Throughout this taper, my legs
felt tired. I am inclined to blame it on two non-running related factors.
First, TAing had restarted, adding 12 hours per week of time on feet. Second,
my sleep had been bad. Bad sleep is a reoccurring problem in my life, but this
time around I was not even able to sleep in from time to time to "reset" the
counter. Body was not letting me. Even the day before the race, a short
recovery with some strides, my legs felt like they had nothing to give. The
strides felt horrible.

## Goals and Strategy

The main goal was to PR. I had run 39 low back in October on a hilly and muddy
course, that was likely short. I figured it evened out though. Before that, I
would have to go back to that previous edition of this race back in 2016 and its
39:45.

More specifically, I looked at some other times I had run to decide on the pace
I wanted. I went for my mile time trial. Based on that, I would have to run
a 37:30 or faster in this 10 km. A 3:45 pace was going to be the goal.

## Race

The race organisers had decided to add a few 100 metre to the start. Rather
than starting on the grass field right next to the stadium, we now started from
the track in the stadium. Their website now stated it was a 10.4 km course.
Adding a few 100 metre indeed. I figured this should not make me change my
plans though, just do the pace I had in mind and see where it brings me.

What did have me worried was how my legs were feeling during the warmup. Just
like the day before: shit. Like there was no punch to them. Not the feeling I
am looking for on race day.

I started out controlled, still a surprising feat for me, but perhaps not as
surprising when you consider the legs feeling like shit. Still started out a
little bit too fast, but managed to reel it in. A few 100 metre in, I already
had nobody to follow any more.  I felt someone behind me, but it is not like I
could force him to lead. So, left to my own devices, I just focused on the
pace. The lead group was pulling away in the distance and from time to time
some where dropped by it.

> GPS splits: 3:49, 3:45, 3:48.

I caught up to one of those that may have been dropped by the lead pack around
the end of the third kilometre. I took a breather of sorts as I settled in
behind him. Stare at his red shirt and just follow.  Around this time I had a
first glance at the guy that I had felt behind me earlier. He was still there.
White-blueish shirt. Looks like we had ourselves a group. I followed red shirt
as we navigated around the only really precarious footing of the course: some
weird mix of stones and deep drops between them filled with earth. Treacherous.
Near the end of that section, a spectator called out "nine, ten, eleven". I
guess those were our positions.

After sitting on red shirt's tail for a kilometre, my watch beeped and told me
I was slacking. I moved back past red shirt and sped up some. Red and white
followed as I led our pack for the next two km. We passed somebody else in
those two km and I took a mental note that our group of three would now be
fighting for positions eight, nine, and ten.

> GPS splits: 3:56, 3:48, 3:47.

Near the end of the sixth kilometre we made a turn. I do not recall if we
suddenly had more headwind, but that might explain the pace. It dropped. Hard.
I started struggling some and at one point red shirt took over again. From what
I recall, we exchanged a few times, but red shirt led most of the seventh and
eighth kilometre. White shirt just kept on following.

> GPS splits: 4:03, 4:02.

I felt a bit recovered after those two slower kms and tried pushing the pace
some again. We were getting closer to the finish line _and_ I saw a guy up
ahead that we were slowly reeling in. The pushing worked and I made us catch up
to him as we were nearing the end of the ninth kilometre. I thought to briefly
sit behind him, but red and white disagreed.  One from each side they
immediately started overtaking me and the guy we had just caught up to.  I
decided to stick to my group and matched my speed to theirs. We dropped the guy
we had just caught up to and were now in positions seven, eight, and nine.
Guess it was left to the three of us to duke it out and see who could get
seventh.

> GPS split: 3:54.

With under a kilometre to go, we were all perhaps trying to look strong,
running more side-by-side than behind one another. There is of course a
difference between still looking strong and still being strong. From my
previous participation, I recalled the narrow turns we had to take to get onto
the track. I figured it would be a good idea to be at the front for those turns
to see if I could put some distance on my fellows before we reached the track.
White shirt must have thought the same, because as we turned onto the grass
before the narrow turns, he took the lead for the first time in the race.
500-600 metre to go still and he was speeding up.  I thought to follow, but
quickly noticed I had nothing left to give. Red fared a little bit better, but
still had to leave a gap. As they both pulled away, I could not do anything. I
was dropped.  We had reached the track and, realising I was not going to catch
up, I glanced behind me to ensure nobody was going to overtake me.  In
retrospect, I do not know if I could have done anything if it had been the
case, but at the time it felt reassuring to see emptiness.  My watch beeped
with about 200 metre left on the track (3:51). From afar I saw red not managing
to close the gap on white any more. Eventually I too finished.

## Results

I was sure I would be ninth, but the announcer said tenth. Apparently the
spectator earlier had not counted correctly. A slight disappointment at the
time, but really it does not matter.
