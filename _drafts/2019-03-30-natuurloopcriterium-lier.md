I felt like updating my 10 km PR. The usual equivalence tables said it was my
softest time, meaning it should be an easy one to improve.  I decided on
running one I ran back in November 2016: the [Natuurloopcriterium
Lier][lier2016]. This criterium holds a 10 km race (and some others) five times
in the winter months. More importantly: it is flat.

## Course Details

It is a flat course along the canals in the village of Lier. It is almost
entirely paved, besides some short grass patches, and a short part with weird
uneven rocks with gaps in-between them. There is no shade at the time of day of
the race, which was planned to start at 13:50. Not too many tight turns.
Largely perfect really.  Oh and the organisers decided to increase the length
of the course compared to last time I ran it.  They were now calling it a *10.4
km course*. Bleb.

## Training


## Goals and Strategy

The main goal was to PR. I had run 39 low back in October on a hilly and muddy
course, that was likely short. I figured it evened out though.  Before that, I
would have to go back to that previous edition of this race that I did and its
39:45.

More specifically, I looked at some other times I had run to decide on the pace
I wanted. I went for my mile time trial. Based on that, I would have to run
a 37:30 or faster in this 10 km. A 3:45 pace was going to be the goal.

## Getting There

Sleep has been on the bad side (story of my life). Usually I manage to sleep in
from time to time though. This had not happened the week and then some before
the race though, so that got me worried slightly. Besides that I had about a
week of taper, after my parkrun the Saturday before.

Total pain to get there
with public transport, which, alas, was our only option.  Luckily the race was
not till 13:50, so plenty of time to wake up in peace and still get there on
time.
