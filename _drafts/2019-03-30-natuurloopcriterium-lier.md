I felt like updating my 10 km PR. The usual equivalence tables said it was my
softest time, meaning it should be an easy one to improve. I decided on running
one I ran back in November 2016: the [Natuurloopcriterium Lier][lier2016]. This
criterium holds a 10 km race (and some other distances) five times in the
winter months. More importantly: it is flat.

## Course Details

It is a flat course along the canals in the village of Lier. It is almost
entirely paved, besides some short grass patches, and a short part with weird
uneven rocks with gaps in-between them. There is no shade at the time of day of
the race, which was planned to start at 13:50. Not too many tight turns.
Pretty great really. Oh and the organisers decided to increase the length of
the course compared to last time I ran it. They were now calling it a *10.4 km
course*. Bleb ðŸ˜©

## Training

### Six Day Cycles

I had wanted to play around with a different length cycle than the usual seven
day cycle. The idea is that three workouts in a seven day week leads to not
having enough recovery days between workouts.  Instead, you aim to have two
recovery days in-between each workout. In essence I was already having enough
recovery days in the past, by often planning just two workouts (i.e., a workout
plus a long run) in my seven day week. At first I thought to use a nine or ten
day cycle with three workouts per cycle, a solution I have heard before often.
In my mind, however, you have just one long run per *x* day cycle, at the end
of the cycle. I was not really in the mood to have fewer long runs (one every
seven days versus one every nine or ten days). Breaking the entire idea down to
three day blocks (recovery, recovery, workout), I eventually decided to give
six day cycles a try: recovery, recovery, workout, recovery, recovery, long
run. Not sure I have heard of people doing this yet, but as long as I run
enough with enough easy and enough hard, I figured I could not do much wrong.

### The Plan

I went through eight six day cycles in the run up to the race. Right before the
first one, I also had a seven day one that I count as part of the decision to
run this race. Thus, you could see it as nine cycles. By default, every cycle
had a long run on its last day. The other workout was placed on the third day
of each cycle. Easy-easy-workout-easy-easy-long. I will use Jack Daniels
terminology to say what the workout entailed.

The first three cycles had **R**eptition workouts: repeats of 200 or 400 metre
with equidistant rest. Pace is from JD tables, but might be around 1 km race
pace or faster? Not sure as I do not race those distances. The first two went
alright, I think I kinda like this short fast work. Reassuring since I have
been having half a mind of doing a training cycle focused on 1500 metre to 3000
metre. Speaking of which, curious about the state my body was in, I replaced
the R workout of the third cycle with a mile time trial. Result: few seconds
slower than what I had in November, but I might just have been more tired now.
Did not taper for either.

For the next five cycles I wanted to alternate **T**hreshold (about 20-30
minutes around 1 hour race pace) and **I**ntervals (reps of 3-5 minutes at 3-5
km race pace, rest about half to 90% of the time). In other words T, I, T, I,
T. The first and second cycle felt alright. In the third one (a lower volume
cycle), my body felt too tired and I ended up dropping the T. Then for
scheduling I switched around the next two cycles. Finally, I turned that last
I workout into a parkrun race. So the workouts of the five cycles ended up as
T, I, none, T, I-as-race.

Mini race report in race report: I ran 4-5 km to get to the parkrun start,
considered that my warmup. From the start I first tried to keep up with the
lead guys. A few 100 metre in, when checking the pace, I noticed I had
forgotten to press start on the watch. Oops. Little bit further, having pressed
start, I checked again, and noticed that the pace was going to be way too much
to hold for 5 km. Especially since we started up a hill. I started slowing
down, leaving three guys ahead of me. Soon after, another guy passed me pushing
me down to fifth position. One of the original three was also fading though,
probably having made the same mistake as I did. I passed him soon after. It
stayed like this for a bit as I was trying to find a pace that was just easy
enough to carry me to the end. The course consists of two loops and the second
time up the main hill of the course, the guy I had overtaken earlier, went past
me again. He quickly made a decent sized gap. I tried to close it on the
downhill, where I was faster, but did not manage. Eventually I settled to just
run home in fifth spot. The final few 100 metre, a friend came sprinting
alongside me, which made me briefly go faster again. All in all it went OK,
time was 18:07. If I had known I would have been close to dipping under 18
again (remember, forgot to start the watch), I probably would have pushed a bit
more the last km or so. Oh well.

The ninth cycle was a taper cycle. Reduced volume and a race pace test on
Tuesday with the race coming up on Saturday. Throughout this taper, my legs
felt tired. I am inclined to blame it on two non-running related factors.
First, TAing had restarted, adding 12 hours per week of time on feet. Second,
my sleep had been bad. Bad sleep is a reoccurring problem in my life, but this
time around I was not even able to sleep in from time to time to "reset" the
counter. Body was not letting me. Even the day before the race, a short
recovery with some strides, my legs felt like they had nothing to give. The
strides felt horrible.

## Goals and Strategy

The main goal was to PR. I had run 39 low back in October on a hilly and muddy
course that was likely short. I figured it evened out though. Before that, I
would have to go back to that previous edition of this race back in 2016 and its
39:45.

More specifically, I looked at some other times I had run to decide on the pace
I wanted. I went for my mile time trial. Based on that, I would have to run
a 37:30 or faster in this 10 km. A 3:45 pace was going to be the goal.

## Race

The race organisers had decided to add a few 100 metre to the start. Rather
than starting on the grass field right next to the stadium, we now started from
the track in the stadium. Their website now stated it was a 10.4 km course.
Adding a few 100 metre indeed. I figured this should not make me change my
plans though, just do the pace I had in mind and see where it brings me.

What did have me worried was how my legs were feeling during the warmup. Just
like the day before: shit. Like there was no punch to them. Not the feeling I
am looking for on race day. On top of that it was 19C and sunny on a course
with mostly no shade. Spring suddenly hit and I had not been training in any
weather similar to it.

I started out controlled, still a surprising feat for me, but perhaps not as
surprising when you consider the legs feeling like shit. Still started out a
little bit too fast, but managed to reel it in. A few 100 metre in, I already
had nobody to follow any more. I felt someone behind me, but it is not like I
could force him to lead. So, left to my own devices, I just focused on the
pace. The lead group was pulling away in the distance and from time to time
some where dropped by it.

> GPS splits: 3:49, 3:45, 3:48.

I caught up to one of those that may have been dropped by the lead pack around
the end of the third kilometre. I took a breather of sorts as I settled in
behind him. Stare at his red shirt and just follow. Around this time I had a
first glance at the guy that I had felt behind me earlier. He was still there.
White-blueish shirt. Looks like we had ourselves a group. I followed red shirt
as we navigated around the only really precarious footing of the course: some
weird mix of stones and deep drops between them filled with earth. Treacherous.
Near the end of that section, a spectator called out "nine, ten, eleven". I
guess those were our positions.

After sitting on red shirt's tail for a kilometre, my watch beeped and told me
I was slacking. I moved back past red shirt and sped up some. Red and white
followed as I led our pack for the next two km. We passed somebody else in
those two km and I took a mental note that our group of three would now be
fighting for positions eight, nine, and ten.

> GPS splits: 3:56, 3:48, 3:47.

Near the end of the sixth kilometre we made a turn. I do not recall if we
suddenly had more headwind, but that might explain the pace. It dropped. Hard.
I started struggling some and at one point red shirt took over again. From what
I recall, we exchanged a few times, but red shirt led most of the seventh and
eighth kilometre. White shirt just kept on following.

> GPS splits: 4:03, 4:02.

I felt a bit recovered after those two slower kms and tried pushing the pace
some again. We were getting closer to the finish line _and_ I saw a guy up
ahead that we were slowly reeling in. The pushing worked and I made us catch up
to him as we were nearing the end of the ninth kilometre. I thought to briefly
sit behind him, but red and white disagreed. One from each side they
immediately started overtaking me and the guy we had just caught up to. I
decided to stick to my group and matched my speed to theirs. We dropped the guy
we had just caught up to and were now in positions seven, eight, and nine.
Guess it was left to the three of us to duke it out and see who could get
seventh.

> GPS split: 3:54.

With under a kilometre to go, we were all perhaps trying to look strong,
running more side-by-side than behind one another. There is of course a
difference between still looking strong and still being strong. From my
previous participation, I recalled the narrow turns we had to take to get onto
the track. I figured it would be a good idea to be at the front for those turns
to see if I could put some distance on my fellows before we reached the track.
White shirt must have thought the same, because as we turned onto the grass
before the narrow turns, he took the lead for the first time in the race.
500-600 metre to go still and he was speeding up. I thought to follow, but
quickly noticed I had nothing left to give. Red fared a little bit better, but
still had to leave a gap. As they both pulled away, I could not do anything. I
was dropped. We had reached the track and, realising I was not going to catch
up, I glanced behind me to ensure nobody was going to overtake me. In
retrospect, I do not know if I could have done anything if it had been the
case, but at the time it felt reassuring to see emptiness. My watch beeped
with about 200 metre left on the track (3:51). From afar I saw red not managing
to close the gap on white any more. Eventually I too finished.

## Results

I was sure I would be ninth, but the announcer said tenth. Apparently the
spectator earlier had not counted correctly. A slight disappointment at the
time, but really it does not matter. The [results] put my time at 39:25 while
my [watch][strava] says 39:24. There was no chip time and I started pretty much
first/second row, so I am more inclined to believe my watch. Then again, the
second does not matter in this case. Red shirt finished in 39:14, white shirt
in 39:11. The guy we passed in the final 1-2 km finished in 39:55. The winner
did it all in 33:16.

As for PRing... Well there it gets tricky. The time as is is not faster than
what I ran on the hilly muddy slightly short course in October. However, the
organisers do claim the course is now 10.4 km. Some quick calculations,
assuming the average pace, make the 10 km split to be at 37:53. The GPS had the
course at 10.18 with a 10 km split of 38:40. In other words, I am pretty sure
I PRed in this race, but I am not sure what time to take as a PR. Sigh.

### What Went Wrong

So when a race does not go as planned, it is key to find what went wrong. This
way, you can avoid it from happening next time. In this case, there are a few
reasons that did not help.

1. Course was long. Besides picking my races better in the future, I cannot do
   much about the course.
2. Weather got warmer than it had been. I could have maybe felt more accustomed
   to this with some heat training, but I do not care enough to do such a
   thing. Nor can I imagine _that_ is the real limiting factor in all of this.
3. Bad sleep for a while in the lead up. Bad sleep is a part of my life and I
   do not know if I will ever be able to fix that. My routine had been shook up
   leading up to this race, so that did make things worse than usual.
4. Heavy legs feeling powerless. This is the one thing I should have been able
   to avoid. Either I can blame it on the sleep and the extra time on feet from
   TAing or I fucked up in tapering. Leading up to the race I ensured my volume
   dropped. As for intensity, I had the parkrun exactly a week before this race
   and a race pace session on Tuesday (1200m @ 10k race pace). Perhaps the
   parkrun was a bit too much to schedule in? I am not sure.

I do not think my six day cycles are to blame in any way. I will continue
trying to use them for the rest of my spring planning and then see afterwards
whether I stick with the idea. The lack of consistency in what day holds what
kind of workout does make things a lot harder to plan for. That is a big con I
have found so far and it exists in all cycles not following seven days.

## Future

For upcoming events this spring I have

* Antwerp 10 miles on 28 April
* 12 urenloop on 8 May (relays of 550 metre each for 12 hours)
* 20 km door Brussel on 19 May

My main goal _was_ to aim for (close to) an hour at the Antwerp 10 miles. That
already was a stretch goal, but this race has made it sound pretty impossible.
I would have to go through 10 km in 37:17 en route to a 1 hour 10 miler. On the
other hand, nobody cares about 10 mile PRs, especially in metric land. So
blowing up would not necessarily mean anything to me. I am still tempted to
try. Especially since finding out they _will_ have a 1 hour pacer. The next
pacer is at 1:10, definitely too slow.

The 12 urenloop I will probably do more as a fucked up long run than as a race.
Of course, I said something similar last year and still went pretty hard.

The 20 km finally is just a little extra. I figure I should show up in case the
weather is nice and cool so I can update my personal course best.

After all that, I am leaning towards trying JD's training plan for a 1500-3000m
race. After doing two mile TTs for shit and giggles, I kind of want to at least
try and push my time under 5:00. It helps that I started liking the short **R**
work this cycle. It seems to come up a lot in that training plan. Will have to
see if I still like it if I do nearly nothing else week in week out.
