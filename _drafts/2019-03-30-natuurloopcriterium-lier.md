I felt like updating my 10 km PR. The usual equivalence tables said it was my
softest time, meaning it should be an easy one to improve. I decided on
running one I ran back in November 2016: the [Natuurloopcriterium
Lier][lier2016]. This criterium holds a 10 km race (and some others) five times
in the winter months. More importantly: it is flat.

## Course Details

It is a flat course along the canals in the village of Lier. It is almost
entirely paved, besides some short grass patches, and a short part with weird
uneven rocks with gaps in-between them. There is no shade at the time of day of
the race, which was planned to start at 13:50. Not too many tight turns.
Pretty great really. Oh and the organisers decided to increase the length of
the course compared to last time I ran it. They were now calling it a *10.4 km
course*. Bleb ðŸ˜©

## Training

### Six Day Cycles

I had wanted to play around with a different length cycle than the usual seven
day cycle. The idea is to ensure having two recovery days in-between each
workout. In essence I was already having enough recovery days in the past, by
often planning just two workouts (i.e., a workout plus a long run) in my seven
day week. The idea was to use a nine or ten day cycle in order to have more
workouts, but still have two days of recovery (a rest day or an easy run)
in-between each run. In my mind, however, you have just one long run per *x*
day cycle, at the end of the cycle. I was not really in the mood to have fewer
long runs (one every seven days versus one every nine or ten days). Breaking
the entire idea down to three day blocks (recovery, recovery, workout), I
eventually decided to give six day cycles a try: recovery, recovery, workout,
recovery, recovery, long run. Not sure I have heard of people doing this yet,
but as long as I run enough with enough easy and enough hard, I figured I could
not do much wrong.

## Goals and Strategy

The main goal was to PR. I had run 39 low back in October on a hilly and muddy
course, that was likely short. I figured it evened out though. Before that, I
would have to go back to that previous edition of this race that I did and its
39:45.

More specifically, I looked at some other times I had run to decide on the pace
I wanted. I went for my mile time trial. Based on that, I would have to run
a 37:30 or faster in this 10 km. A 3:45 pace was going to be the goal.

## Getting There

Sleep has been on the bad side (story of my life). Usually I manage to sleep in
from time to time though. This had not happened the week and then some before
the race though, so that got me worried slightly. Besides that I had about a
week of taper, after my parkrun the Saturday before.

Total pain to get there
with public transport, which, alas, was our only option. Luckily the race was
not till 13:50, so plenty of time to wake up in peace and still get there on
time.
