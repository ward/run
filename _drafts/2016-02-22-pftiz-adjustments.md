Got the 20k coming up, will use pfitz' half marathon plan.

Issues:

* Due to transportation, I only race in Brussels.
* I do not want to replace a race from his plan with a tempo run.
* Races are pretty much only on Sunday
* Limiting yourself to Brussels limits the possible races. Only have ULB and Woluwe

Changes:

* Swap week 9 and 10 to fit for Woluwe. 9 was already following another race week, so
  in terms of recovery from that, it should be ok
* Race is on Sunday, not saturday. Give up on the long run on tired legs. Sunday's run
  moves to Wednesday. This keeps in the distance and (hopefully) is enough recovery
  for the race. If need be, it can be taken as GA as well, to give a better shot at the
  race. Wednesday's GA moves to Thursday. Friday's pre-race recovery moves to Saturday,
  the race itself moves from Saturday to Sunday.
* For ULB: week 8 moves in front of week 6, shifting 6 and 7 down.
* Optionally change old week 6 (now week 7) its Tuesday run to be slightly easier. E.g.
  drop the hill speed work or lower amounts of the strides and what not.
* Use the same adoptions to the new week 8 (now week 6) as were made to the race week
  for woluwe.
