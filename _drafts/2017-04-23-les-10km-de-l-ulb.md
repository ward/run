A bit of a change from the usual! Due to injury-ridden January and February, my
fitness is nowhere near where I would want it to be. A pity for spring racing
season. The 2017 edition of the first race I ever ran, [Les 10km de
l'ULB][10kulb] was coming up and I knew I was not going to get in a shape to
speak of. I would not be happy with whatever result I could run. Instead, I
decided to volunteer.

## Training

The organisation sent us (the girlfriend decided to also volunteer) a list of
keywords for questions we might receive from runners. I made sure to study
it/read it a few times as well as looking at the map of the area a few times to
make sure I knew what was where (think bag drop off, bib pick up, ...). Since
we were in the list for bib handout, the girlfriend also practised her
listening comprehension of French numbers.

## Race Day

The race would start at 10:30. The organisation had asked us to be present at
8:00. Some others had to be there at 6:00 already, so that could have been
worse. We woke up at 6:00 and did not care too much about our morning routine.
The organisation said that there would be some croissants for us, but my
experience with relying on a breakfast like that is that I am usually left
hungry. So, I had a bowl of muesli. We calmly got ready and were out the door
a little past seven. The girlfriend went by public transportation and I biked.
We both arrived nicely at 8:00, within a few minutes of one another.

We were given a T-shirt and one croissant each. Good thing I had that bowl of
muesli. The girlfriend was happy to also make use of their coffee.
