After the lactate test a few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to run a 5000m soonâ„¢
to compare the lactate test results to an all out effort. There are still no
races here in Belgium till 1 August, so I set my mind on time trialling a 5000m
on the track of the athletics club I am in. For planning purposes, I mentioned
it to the head coach there, who immediately offered to pace me. He is quite a
bit faster so that is nice. Logistically I figured I would just aim for the
later parts of a regular clubtraining, hoping it would not be too busy any
more.
