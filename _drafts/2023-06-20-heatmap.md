A long overdue update on my heatmapping, the previous two updates were all the
way back in [Jan 2022][heatmap2022jan] and in [May 2021][heatmap2021may].
Eighteen months have passed, so you might imagine I have made some progress.

## Running Every Street in Brussels

Done and dusted. I achieved this goal on 18 Oct 2022, being the first, as far
as I can tell, to complete Brussels. After that was completed, I still spent
some time cleaning up the map. Sometimes [CityStrides] marks a street as
complete despite you not having run properly through it. This involved checking
at the map and looking for gaps in streets. I think I got everything significant.

Once that was done, I also ended up turning on CityStrides' "hard mode". It
sounds fancier than it is. When trying to complete a street, it tends to offer
you some respite from shitty GPS by counting a street completed as long as you
ran by 90% of the nodes in the street. Hard mode turns that off and requires
100% of nodes. Flipping the switch forced me to redo about 1-2% of streets in
Brussels. This was done in Feb-Mar 2023.

### and Kraainem

At some point, I decided to start running the streets of Kraainem. This city is
right up against Brussels (and, I imagine, would be _part_ of Brussels in many
other countries). All runs for it involved starting from my work, running about
6 km in one direction, doing some streets, and running the 6 km back.

## Long Dumb Shit

At first the trips in this section felt a little over the top and like a bit of
a time sink. But with a clear goal in mind, i.e., making my heatmap cross
Belgium, I justified their existence. At some point in the last 18 months,
however, I got sort of addicted to them. Take the train somewhere, go for a
run, often to another station, optional city sightseeing, take the train back.

I lovingly call them my "Long Dumb Shit" Adventures, since I tend to only
justify the effort for long runs.

### Cross Belgium: North-West to South-East

### The Belgian Coast

### Cross Belgium: North to South

### Tricountry Points

The Belgium-France-Luxembourg point I finished when working on my North-West to
South-East connection across Belgium. It was the South-East endpoint.

#### Belgium-Netherlands-Germany

#### Belgium-Germany-Luxembourg
