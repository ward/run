A long overdue update on my heatmapping, the previous two updates were all the
way back in [Jan 2022][heatmap2022jan] and in [May 2021][heatmap2021may].
Eighteen months have passed, so you might imagine I have made some progress.

## Running Every Street in Brussels

Done and dusted. I achieved this goal on 18 Oct 2022, being the first person to
do so, as far as I can tell, to complete Brussels. After that was completed, I
still spent some time cleaning up the map. Sometimes [CityStrides] marks a
street as complete despite you not having run properly through it. This
involved checking at the map and looking for gaps in streets. I think I got
everything significant.

Once that was done, I also ended up turning on CityStrides' "hard mode". It
sounds fancier than it is. When trying to complete a street, it tends to offer
you some respite from shitty GPS by counting a street completed as long as you
ran by 90% of the nodes in the street. Hard mode turns that off and requires
100% of nodes. Flipping the switch forced me to redo about 1-2% of streets in
Brussels. This was done in Feb-Mar 2023.

### and Kraainem

At some point after Brussels, I decided to start running the streets of
Kraainem. This city is right up against Brussels (and, I imagine, would be
_part_ of Brussels in many other countries). All runs for it involved starting
from my work, running about 6 km in one direction, doing some streets, and
running the 6 km back.

## Long Dumb Shit

At first the trips I had to make to get anywhere with these goals felt a little
over the top and like a bit of a time sink. But with a clear goal in mind,
i.e., making my heatmap cross Belgium, I justified their existence. At some
point in the last 18 months, however, I got sort of addicted to them. Take the
train somewhere, go for a run in a different environment, optional city
sightseeing, take the train back.

I now lovingly call them my "Long Dumb Shit" Adventures, since I tend to only
justify the effort for long runs.

### Cross Belgium: North-West to South-East

This goal was the first to spark my interest. I wanted to run across Belgium.
One could do this more easily just going north to south, the shortest route.
That felt a bit boring, so instead I wanted to connect the north-western point
to the south-eastern point. That's the Belgian-Dutch coastal border on the one
hand and the Belgian-French-Luxembourgish tricountry point on the other.

The work on this started in earnest around March 2022 and became a real focus
by September. The north-western side was relatively easy, the furthest I had to
go by train was about an hour. The south-eastern side was more of a time sink.
For the furthest parts the train takes around three hours. Those trips were a
bit much. The final connection was eventually made on 26 November 2022.

I used the train for all of these, running between stations.

### The Belgian Coast

After the main goal, I snuck in an easy one. Running the Belgian coast might
sound like a feat if you do not know the geography, but it is only 65-70 km in
length. I had already done some parts of it too, needing just another two runs
to finish it. This was accomplished on 10 December 2022.

### Cross Belgium: North to South

When I came back to my Long Dumb Shit in February, I decided to make that
north-south connection after all, realising I needed just four long runs. Guess
how many weekends February has? Completed that goal by the end of the month.

### Tricountry Points

The Belgium-France-Luxembourg point I finished when working on my North-West to
South-East connection across Belgium. It was the South-East endpoint.
