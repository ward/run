Every year, my university holds a 12 hour relay. Teams compete against one
another to run the most laps in 12 hours, switching runners every lap. [Last
year][12uren2017] I took part a bit haphazardly, running 13 laps way harder
than I had wanted to.

This year, I felt like taking part with a larger contribution and not letting
myself get caught up as much as last year, lasting longer.
