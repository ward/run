My training plan for the 20 km door Brussel on 29 May asks for a tune up race.
I however want to stay within Brussels and this greatly reduces the amount of
options I have. As such, I went for a race I did last year while preparing for
the 20 km: [Les 10km de l'ULB][ulb], a race organised by the Cercle des
Sciences (CdS), a student group for science students at the Université Libre de
Bruxelles (ULB). Two reasons will likely always convince me to pass by this
race: my own student group evolved out of theirs for the purpose of the science
students at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB, the Dutch equivalent of the
ULB); and [a lot of the money raised goes to science research][research].  I
had to shuffle my plan around a bit to fit it in, but I figured *a* race was
better than nothing and the alternative of doing a time trial on a track
sounded horrible.

## Training

I have been following Pete Pfitzinger's lowest half marathon plan (12 weeks up
to 76 km per week) with [some modifications][pfitzmods]. I had to shuffle
the weeks around quite a bit to fit this race in properly, but all in all I
felt OK with the preparation. I am now halfway through the 12 weeks and this was
a nice moment to see where I stand. The week leading up to the race was heavy
though, leaving my legs quite tired on Thursday. The rest day on Friday and the
short recovery run on Saturday really were needed to get my legs in somewhat
decent race shape.

I am unsure whether the leg tiredness is due to me shuffling the weeks around
and ending up with a heavier week earlier than intended or whether it would
have been happening regardless at this point. I am hoping for the latter of
course as it would give me more confidence going into the final six weeks of
this plan. I think the next two weeks will be able to tell.

## Course details

The course is mostly the same as last year's, though they changed the direction
around. The hills are all still there though. I went to [check it
out][ulbcheckout] two weeks prior and it could definitely ruin your legs soon
if you do not pay attention.

In the first two kilometre, you climb 15-20 metre, descend them, and then climb
them again. It briefly flattens out somewhat and then climbs another 15-20
metre to bring you at the end of the third km. By this point the road has also
turned into a dirt path or cobbles (it changes at times).

From that point it is mostly downhill till 4.1 km in, with one downside. One
turn of close to π and another well over π/2. Both force you to slow down and
speed back up. You have now reached the lowest point of the course, so
naturally it is time to start climbing again. All the way till 6.5 km in you
are going to be mostly unhappy with the grade you are running on. On the way
there, you also pass a water stand in case you need to splash some in your
face.

On the plus side, that was also the highest point and up until 8.3 km you can
take advantage of that by (mostly) descending. Time to catch your breath for
the final speed ups, if you have anything left. And immediately lose it again.
Over the next 400 metre, you climb 20 metre you were no longer in the mood for.
You are almost at the finish though and can now cruise downwards (again,
mostly) until the final 200 metre of the race, which go up again to squeeze the
most out of your final kick.

## Goals and Strategy

Goals before the race were (from estimated hard to easy):

1. Sub 40. I did not realistically think I could make it though, the course is
   10.3km (according to their website) and the hills in it are substantial
   enough to make proper pacing difficult.
2. Top 50. Going by last year's times, I thought the improvement could be there
   to just make it. Last year's 50th person ran it in 40:56. (last year I was
   177th out of 2447 finishers)
3. Sub 42. If it were exactly 10km, this should have definitely been possible,
   I reckoned. The extra 300 metre add more than a minute though, so I did not
   feel particularly sure still.
4. Do better than the girlfriend. She was aiming for top female, I figured I
   should try to at least run faster than that then. Going by our results in
   races we both did, this goal seemed definitely attainable.
5. Break my 10k PR from training. This was set at 43:45 from a lactate
   threshold run on completely flat terrain in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) two
   weeks prior.
6. Break my 10k PR from racing. This was set last year on this course in the
   other direction at 44:52.

Phew, that was quite the long list of goals. I blame it on not racing a 10k
often. That is, this was my second 10k, my first one being this race last year
and I still did (and do) not know what to really expect from it. I did have a
[9 km][rcbhivernales] about two months ago and completely blew up in that due
to bad planning of the race itself. Not much to learn from that beyond that I
need to pace myself better.

Which leads me to my relatively simple strategy. In an attempt to avoid blowing
up again, I planned to start at a heart rate of 170. This is what I usually aim
for during my tempo runs, so I assumed it should be manageable throughout a 10
km race. The idea was to keep it at this for at least the first six km and then
see how much I had left to speed up.
