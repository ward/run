We're back! My first race since an [indoor 3000m in February 2020][bskindoor].
Since then COVID19 ruined everyone's plans a little and I messed up my ankle a
little (see the multitude of posts about that one). Now that I finally feel
like I have some consistent volume again, if not necessarily consistent speed
work, I figured it was time to get back into racing. Any racing. This one was
relatively close to me, so I could bike there (in the end I got a ride anyway).
The distance was also acceptable. I think I prefer focussing on the 5000m and
10000m events, but 3000m will do.

The lucky race? A meet in the Flanders Cup, this one in Huizingen held by the
OEH. Apparently the meets in the Flanders Cup are all similar in their setup
(or so I've heard, this is my first one). A decent chunk of people sign up,
including plenty foreigners. All the fast people get put in the main heat for
their chosen distance. Everyone else gets put in other heats held at a later
point in the day. Case in point: the main heat for the 3000m was to be held at
19:25. My heat and others would not start till 22:10.

## Training

After the [bruised ribs mishap in May][bruisedrib], I quickly went back on the
volume I had built back right before the rib bruising. I also did not play much
with distance: regular weeks @ 100 km, down weeks @ 80 km. I wanted to get
fully used to this again. Adding intensity back took a little longer. I still
felt my ribs till early to mid June and then hurt my right heel a little
blasting down some rocky hill. All told I did not add any quality (unless you
count long runs and some sporadic strides) until early July.

On 8 July I did a Repetition workout, trying to get some speed back into my
legs. It was 8×200m and felt pretty smooth throughout. I tried to just go by
feel and clocked mostly 36s. The week after I had a planned down week, reduced
volume, no workout. The week after that down week, I did another Repetition
workout. This one was 5×400m and felt rough. Warmer (26C) and sunny day, I got
a bit of a sidestitch going during the warmup and the abs felt a bit rough
throughout. Splits averaged 74s.  Then I spent a week in Slovenia which
hampered my running a bit: quite some hiking, some too steep running, oh and I
twisted my left ankle. Whoops.  The Slovenia week ended up being a bit of a
wash: no workout and the final distance for the week was just shy of 70 km.
Then last week I was back at 100 km volume and did another Repetition workout.
Bumping it up some more from last time, I did 6×400m, again at ±74s. The
workout felt noticeably better than the previous one.

Finally in the week of the race I still wanted to keep a non-race workout
planned in as well as sticking to my 100 km weekly volume. I moved my workout
up from the usual Thursday to Tuesday and changed it to mostly Threshold stuff
with some 3k race pace at the end as a test (4×1.5k T; 600m @ 3k race pace). I
figured the Threshold was light enough, but would still emulate some fatigue
when doing the race pace part. Hopefully a good test for the race itself. For
the Threshold parts I aimed for 3:35 / km, which is Jack Daniels' suggestion
for my 5000m PB. Possibly a little fast, but I was fine with that. The "3k race
pace" here is 3:20 per km (80s per lap, 10:00 for 3000m). See the next section
for my reasoning for that. With the race on Saturday, I also expected to still
do a long run on Sunday. Was not looking forward to that one.

## Goal and Strategy

In my indoor 3000m in February 2020, I had aimed for 10:00 (well, just faster
than 10:00, evidently). I ran alone from the gun, even though I might have been
able to hold on to a group that ran slightly in front of me, stubbornly not
wanting to blow up. I still got into rough mental terrain, slowed down some,
and in the end only ran 10:09.

My [5000m TT][5ktt] from July 2020 suggested a 9:41-9:46, depending on which
calculator you want to believe. Evidently since that my training had been shit,
what with the broken ankle and all. I have no plans to gamble for that
estimate.

Instead I figured I once more should go for 10:00. If I am near that 5k TT
shape, it should be "easy" enough. Ideally there is some group I can run with.
I should probably allow some leeway here and try to follow a group even if they
go a bit faster than 10:00. I think I rather _not_ be on my own again, TTing.
At least then if I start blowing up, I can put all my focus on trying to follow
the guy in front of me. Hopefully.

So goal: sub 10, strategy: hang on to someone. If things fail, it does not
matter much to me, this is just to get back into racing.
