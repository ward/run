I wrote a rant after the news had come out that Christian Coleman had three
whereabouts failures in one year. The writing was in reaction to episode 501
from the [House of Run][houseofrun] podcast. In it, the hosts reacted to the
news and I found their reaction a bit too easy going on Coleman. I wrote this
_before_ Coleman got off on a technicality and sent it to House of Run. House
of Run reacted to my mail in episode 502. Episode 502 was made after Coleman
got off.

My ranting mail in question:

> Listened to episode 501 the other day and your reactions on the Coleman news.
> I was a bit disappointed in how you compared missing tests to getting caught
> red-handed. Here in Belgium we are pretty big on cycling and I have followed
> it for most of my life. As a lifelong cycling fan I can tell you: yes,
> missing tests feels the same to me as getting caught red-handed. Yes, if the
> ruling stands you should see him as dopeman-Coleman. To all your "should we"
> questions that felt somewhat forgiving already towards Coleman. Yes, yes,
> yes, you should see this as a strong black mark.
>
> There are plenty of documented cases from old dopers where they explain you
> should avoid getting tested while you know you are positive. Dodging testers,
> training in a country with an almost non-existing anti-drug sytem, not
> opening the door when testers ring, ... Read former cyclist Tyler Hamilton's
> book "The Secret Race" for some, almost hilarious, examples of how to go
> about it.

> Why would a doper take the dodging approach? Well, evidently failing a test

> Finally, in the eye of the public, as is shown by your reaction, you are more

To summarise:

- A whereabouts miss _is_ a black mark and not something to be waved away.
- Dopers know how long a drug is in their system, they know when they would
  fail a test.
- Missing a test you know you will fail is smarter than taking it.
- Keeping the whereabouts up to date is part of an athlete's job.

In the House of Run reaction to my mail, in episode 502, the hosts understood
my point of view. However, they also were not necessarily willing to have such
a pessimistic outlook on things. We are all just a bunch of humans prone to
mistakes, after all. I cannot blame them, it took me many years of following
cycling to become the cynic I am (and I still love to watch cycling!). I hope
the future will not prove my cynic views right.

As for the current state of affairs: Coleman getting off on a technicality
leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. It would have been better for the case's
perception if one of the missed tests had been properly refuted. "Technically
this miss should be moved to the beginning of the quarter" does not fall in the
category of "properly refuted" in my eyes. The ruling followed the rules of the
World Anti Doping Agency, but sometimes the rules are just shit. I am not sure
I will ever be able to appreciate seeing Coleman in a race again. I hope I can
get over it, because it looks like he is here to stay.
