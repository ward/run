Another stab at racing 10 kilometres. I did this one [two years ago][rcb2016]
and blew up _entirely_. This time around I figured I would pace myself better,
which mostly means not starting too quickly. Two years ago their course was
actually just above 9 km, but they have since rectified this to be 10 km. Or
at least as precise as Belgian standards allow.

## Training

Past weeks have been aimed at low 60 km per week, spread over six days. Two of
the days are recovery days, one should be a tempo, one a longer run. Sprinkle
some strides in there when I remember to. This did not always work out.
Especially the tempo parts, which is the first thing to get cut from the
schedule if other things go wrong. And some things definitely did go wrong. I
managed to roll both ankles in the span of about a week around new year. The
right one especially bothered me as it got swollen and hurt for a week. I had a
few days of sickness (snot, sore throat) about 12 days out from the race.
Besides these things training has been going alright. Low 60s/week seems to
have gotten manageable.

I planned this race to be at the end of a down week. That is, I aimed for about
45 km as week total. So since the Monday leading up to the race, I had run just
short of 35 km.

## Course Details

In comparison to two years ago, a small loop has been added in the final few
kilometre.  I have got some notes that I had written down before the race, but
I like this description that I saw on somebody's Strava activity, because it
does almost feel that way:

> How is it possible for a loop to be uphill the whole way round?!

As for my pre-race notes, this is what they said

- 1.5km flatish (1.5km)
- 1.3km up heavy (2.8km)
- 800m down heavy (3.6)
- 700m up gently (4.3)
- 600m flatish (4.9)
- 700m up moderate (5.6)
- 200m down heavy (5.8)
- 400m up moderate (6.2)
- 1.2km flat/down (7.4)
- 400m down heavy (7.8)
- 500m up heavy (8.3)
- 700m flatish (9)
- 1km down heavy (10)

The first 1.5 km is on streets, after that things are less maintained. You have
some parts that once were paved but have gotten a bit worse for wear, with
cracks and potholes. There are some parts where there are rocks in the ground
keeping the earth together, parts where a thin layer of slippery mud is on top
of that. By and large though it was quite runnable. It also had not been too
wet the days before so that may have helped.

I am writing this a week later after having spent the entire week working every
free hour of my day, so the memory has gotten a bit foggy on those details.

## Goals and Strategy

Do not blow up like last time! That was really my main concern. I figured if I
got through the first 3 km alive (i.e., past the first major hill), everything
would work out. Two years ago I went up that hill _way_ too fast and never
recovered from it. Time wise I figured something in the 40 to 42 minute range
should be doable.

## Race Day

The start was going to be at 10:30. I woke up at 7:30 so I had time to eat in
peace and get my body ready. A bit before 8:30 the girlfriend, who would be
taking pictures, and I were out the door to catch a metro at 8:30. We arrived
at the starting location a little around 9:30-9:35.

I went to pick up my bib and got told "the people from my group" had already
come to pick it up.  I was not part of any group, so I was a bit annoyed with
this. I got told to try their information booth to get it resolved.  Luckily,
there were no issues to fix it there. I got handed a new bib without questions
and it did not cause any problems in terms of my timing afterwards. Nobody
asked for any ID at any point here, which may have been part of the problem to
begin with. Oh well.

I had to go to the toilet and just like two years ago the line was huge. Wasted
a lot of time standing around there. By the time all that was done, I had about
10-15 minutes left till the start. Jogged down to the starting line, did some
strides, and squeezed in threeish rows from the start.

## Race

The thing with my starts is that I often start too quickly.  I have a way to
cheat me through this though.  If I see a woman around the pace I want, I just
stick behind her.  A woman around that pace tends to be better than I am, with
respect to our genders.  So she is also more likely to be better at pacing.
Thus, sticking behind a woman at the start helps me not fuck up.  Which is what
I did.  First 500 metre are behind the woman who won the Jaarmarktjogging Jette
race I participated in back in August. After that I switched to another one
whom I stuck around for the next two or three kilometre.  I believe after that
she turned for the 20 km course.

A guy who was near us at this point must have been part of the organizing
running club.  Every person signalling the road, yelled out "Allez Marc" when
they saw him.  I dropped him once we started the hill after 1.5 km.  Some other
guy passes me up the hill, but I do not let it distract me from my own heart
rate (low 170s, which is around my LT heart rate).  This is the hill I killed
myself on two years ago after all.  He does not get particularly far and on the
downhill right after the climb, I pass him again.  We go a bit back and forth
after that till the 20 km race splits away from the 10 km race just before the
fourth kilometre.  He and the woman who was running nearby peel off for that
one.

For the next kilometre, I am running next to an older guy.  The traily road
here is not the greatest: stones sticking out and the like.  Thus I never
bother squeezing right behind him and just following, but instead we stay
abreast of one another.  Around the 5 km mark, I believe I drop him (I write
this a bit later).

At 5.7ish, we briefly turn onto the side of an actual street for 100-200 metre
before turning back into the forest and its traily ground.  The water stand is
coming up and I see a guy about 10 seconds ahead of me.  At the water stand, he
almost stops completely and I pass him.  I grab a cup of water too, but do not
slow down and just splash it on me.  Drinking from cups is too hard and you do
not need to drink for a 10 km race in cold weather anyway.

We turn right, downwards to the edge of Brussels and Flanders.  This is the
extra bit they added to get the race to 10 km total.  We reach the "border"
around 7.5 km in, run along it briefly and turn back away, up the hill.  I have
a brief difficult moment and a guy passes me.  I figure by this point I might
as well risk blowing up.  I latch onto him.  With about 1.5 km to go, the hill
ends and I am not dead.  From here on out it is first flat and then downhill.
I feel better again, speed up, and drop the guy.  By the time the downhill
starts for the final km, he is already way behind.  The girlfriend is there to
take my picture, though I notice her too late to do any crazy moves.  I keep up
the pace towards the finish line, where the winner has already started his
cooldown run.

## Results

The [results] have me at 41:16 in 40th position out of 872 finishers.  [Strava]
is about the same.  That is 21 spots better than two years ago.  I am recovered
quickly after the race though, my heart rate was in the low 170s throughout, LT
heart rate.  I probably _could_ have pushed slightly more.  While I feel OK
quickly after the race, I do feel my legs during runs on the days after the
race.

The top three finished in 33:24, 34:21, and 36:23. Still a long way to go for
me before I come near that. If ever. Two of the women finished ahead of me:
37:01 and 39:02. Not close to them either.

## Future

I am a bit unsure _what_ to even aim for.  It does not help that I will likely
be abroad for both the 10 km de l'ULB and the 20 km door Brussel, two races I
have used as targets or side targets in the past.  So, I do not really feel
like setting my sights on a particular race just yet. I am happy sticking to
just getting more and better running in.
