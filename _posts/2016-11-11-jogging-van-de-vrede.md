My plan required another 5 km tune-up race before the goal 10 km at the end of
November.  Just like the previous tune-up race, I failed to find a 5 km race
that satisfied my constraints, but managed to find a 4 km instead. The race was
on Friday 11/11, Armistice Day. The race name translates as "Jogging of Peace".
Extra bonus: I knew Laurent, [who beat me in our sprint for spot seven in the
Brussels Canal Run][canalrun], would take part in this one. I hoped for a bit
of a rematch.

## Training

Three weeks had passed since the Brussels Canal Run. Two high weeks immediately
after, followed by a recovery week with the race on Friday. The first of those
two high weeks once more broke my record for most distance in a week: 73.9 km.
Another 1.2 km extra over the record I had set just prior to that race. The
second week should have been even higher, but I backed up a bit to save my
right calf. My muscles were pretty sore the day after the Canal Run and while
most of it fixed itself afterwards, my right calf remained incredibly tight. I
spent a lot of time massaging and foam rolling it, but the tightness remained.
So for the second week I backed off on both intensity (dropping the workout
parts) as distance (cutting about 4 km). That week ended at 71.6 km.

The week of the race had a mini taper. This consisted of 11 km on Tuesday and 5
km on Thursday with some strides. The race was on Friday. Luckily, this mini
taper also fixed the tightness in my right calf. By the time race day came
around, the tightness was gone completely.

## Course Details

The race starts with 500 metre flat-ish. After that a slow climb starts, climbing
30 metre over 1500 metre and putting you at the halfway point. Then comes a quick
drop followed by about 150 metre upwards at 7-8%. After that you are in the clear,
cruising downwards for 1400 metre to the finish line.

Most of the course is on the roads, with a brief stint of 400-500 metre in a
forest at the halfway mark.

## Goals and Strategy

I did not come into this race with a particular time goal. Given the elevation,
I also was not 100% sure how to pace myself. I was happy with taking this as a
rematch against Laurent, so I figured I could just use him as a target. He has
done this race often before, so he knows how to pace it *and* we are similar
enough on short distances. I was wary of the hills in the first half of the
race though, going too hard on them could be paid dearly in the second half,
even [if the second half was mostly downhill][hivernalesrcb].

## Race Day

The girlfriend and I jogged to the start as a little warm up (it is about 5 km
from where we live). We signed up for a whopping â‚¬3, the first time ever I
signed up for a race the day itself. They did not have sign ups beforehand, as
far as I was aware.  This was a bit hectic as they also ran out of safety pins
right after we managed to grab hold of the last few. The rest of the people
were rescued by means of... duct tape.  What can it not fix?

The 4, 8, and 12 km all started at the same time. We figured since we were
doing the 4 km we could probably start at the front. However, a bunch of kids
decided to line up right at the front. Not the athletic looking kind, mind you.
We figured they would sprint the start too fast (faster than us) and then fade
away quickly, so we did not bother trying to get in front of them.

## Race

The kids did indeed sprint as soon as we were off. I managed to start rather
controlled, better than I do usually. I saw Laurent pass me (he started a row
behind me) and immediately latched on to him. I did leave a few metre between
us as this was still "weave through everyone" time and you want to see what
exactly is in front of you. About 150 metre in some guy shoved himself next to
me and then in front of me. He was wearing a baseball cap in reverse that said
NYPD. I found it rather rude, especially because he did not actually continue
going faster once he was in front of me. After 300 metre I was sick of the
crowd and hopped to the empty side where I could pass people without weaving or
pushing. Meanwhile I kept my eye on Laurent.

Once at the 600 metre mark, the climb was starting and I wanted to keep it easy
enough. Laurent was however slowly pulling away. I hesitated briefly, but
decided to let him go. This is also the point where I think I passed the last
of the kids that started at the front.

I kept things controlled, still fearing blowing up too badly. Right before the
forest one guy and then another passed me, but I stuck to my own pace. Then the
uphill ended and I zoomed past both of them on the downhill before the short
upward climb that was to follow. On that upward climb, one of them (in some bright
green clothing) comes next to me again. We crest the hill together and I decide
to just tail him for a bit.

After a few 100 metre of flat-ish and just over 1 km from the finish, a real
downhill part starts again and I let my longer legs carry me past and away from
him. I realise the finish is drawing near, but I am still feeling way too
fresh. I took it too controlled on the uphill leaving me with more energy than
I can spend on the slight downhill to the finish.

With 500 metre left, I checked behind me and saw I had a sizeable gap that I
would not lose.  Sadly the same could be said ahead of me, I would not be
gaining a spot before the finish.  I somewhat let loose and just cruised
towards the finish line. On the way there I spot a photographer on the side.
Having plenty of energy and no worries about time or place, I did the moose.

## Results

Well, it felt like I took things too easy and that showed in [the
results][results].  I finished seventh in 15:10. That is about 50 seconds
slower than three week prior at the Brussels Canal Run (though this was a much
hillier course). As a better comparison: Laurent finished fifth in 14:41. The
rematch that wasn't. Maybe I *should* have just tried following him. Blowing up
be damned.

The NYPD cap guy from the beginning finished in 18:06 as 29th. The guy with the
bright green clothing (at least, I think that was him) finished the 12 km as
seventh in 46:49 which is of course a bit more impressive than my time. None of
those overeager kids finished close to where they started.

The girlfriend for once did not win. She finished the race in 17:14, also
having taken it a bit too easy. This was good enough for second place, the
winner running it in 16:07. At first there was actually some confusion about
the female ranking as a bunch of younger guys apparently found it funny to sign
up as females. Ha. Ha.
