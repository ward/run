I was in London to visit a friend of the girlfriend who wanted to do a race
while there. She had first set her eyes on the [Battersea Park 5k &
10k][battersea], but waited too long with signing up. It was sold out and no
Battersea for her. I did not intend on racing it anyway, for reasons described in
the training section below.

Eager to run any race, she decided on a [parkrun][parkrun], more specifically
the [Beckton parkrun][beckton]. As the concept does not exist in Belgium, I
figured I should take part as well to see what the fuss is all about. While I
did feel like taking part, I did not feel like really racing and figured I
could take it more along the lines of a tempo run, if my body even felt up for
that.

## Course details

The course is situated in Beckton District Park South and about 1.5 km of it is
spent on grass.  This is an important detail. The parkrun the week before was
in muddy conditions, so the ground had taken quite a beating.  For this edition
of the parkrun, the ground was frozen. In other words, all the weird angles
that had been formed last week, were now rockhard and ready to make you twist
an ankle.

The course itself starts off on asphalt which lasts maybe 100 metre. After that
it continues onto grass for 700 metre followed by asphalt again. A Ï€ turn at
the end of a narrow straight called the "corridor", makes sure you lose any
momentum at 1.6 km. At 2 km is a turn onto a wooden bridge which due to the
weather looked white and wet. Lap one is done after 2.5 km and repeated.  The
difference in lap two exists in that you do not turn onto the wooden bridge,
but instead head straight on until a sharp turn back onto grass for a final
sprint of about 100 to 200 metre.

## Training

I finished Pete Pfitzinger's base building plan to 48 km per week a few weeks
ago and have been giving myself some weeks to get used to running 50 km week in
week out. The week before race week, the muscles at the front of my right thigh
were painful, leading me to take it easy throughout the entire week which
solved that issue. The week of the race, sleeping was terrible. Flew during the
night on Monday and could not sleep on the plane. Was on the bus during the
night on Wednesday and could not sleep on the bus. Needless to say, I was
tired. Because of this tiredness, I moved Thursday's 13 km run to Friday,
the day before the parkrun. The evening before the race we also met up with
some redditors in a pub. There are more ideal ways to get ready for a race.
The combination of this all is what made me decide to take this one as a tempo
run of sorts in which I would pace the girlfriend, who *would* go at it like a
race.

## Morning of the Race

No special early getting up and eating in peace. Just some water after waking
up and a run of about three km to the start to get warmed up. We cut it pretty
close and arrived a few minutes before 9:00, when it was supposed to start.
Met up with one of the redditors from the night before, Philip, who lived
nearby and would also take part in the race. He also was kind enough to print
out the barcodes we needed to get our time registered with the parkrun site.
We looked around at a bit at the competition and a few minutes past the hour,
the just over forty people lined up for the start.

## Race

Felt like a slow start, but I still found myself near the front, just behind
two guys running side-by-side. Following people was a bit of a theme during
this race as I had no clue about the course and markings were not always
present. One wearing a blue shirt, one wearing a red shirt. As we ran through
the grass, a glance at my watch told me we were hovering a bit above 4:00 per
km, a glance behind me told me the girlfriend was not really following after a
few 100 metre despite the slower pace. I figured she was not in the mood to go
much faster, so I forewent the plan of pacing her and was left with the plan of
a tempo run.

After about 1 km, red shirt dropped away and I moved in behind blue shirt. He
lasted for a few 100 metre until Philip took over in the corridor. Making sure
not to let myself fall behind, I moved from behind blue shirt to behind Philip.
I think at some point, blue shirt took over again for a while, but not 100%
sure on that any more. Regardless, before the end of the first lap a new
contender, this one in a dark shirt, went to the front. Once again, I moved in
behind the leader, remaining in second position. At the end of lap one, dark
shirt was leading with me in second position and Philip and blue shirt trailing.

Back onto the grass and I came to the conclusion that this would end up
slightly harder than a tempo run. The goal from here on out was to trail dark
shirt until near the end and then push past him for a victory. Easy enough as
our pace was still easy enough, hanging around 4:00 per km. I also decided to
only worry about dark shirt in front of me, as I felt Philip and blue shirt
behind me slowly fading.

Dark shirt starts speeding up in the corridor and I follow easily enough. The
corridor goes well and after that I start turning towards the wooden bridge
around the 4.5 km mark.  Dark shirt however does not turn and the volunteers
start waving at me to continue straight on. This is apparently where lap two
diverges from lap one. Remember kids, study the course beforehand! I turn back
in the proper direction and speed up to close the tiny gap created because of
my faulty start of a turn. Immediately I also think "well, we must be really
close to the finish then!" and take it as my cue to race past dark shirt and
towards victory.

I pull up next to dark shirt and... blow up. I feel I cannot sustain this
effort and fade away from beside him. I fall further back as we make a final
muddy turn back onto a patch of grass. The gap is already several seconds, so I
glance back and see nobody. At least place two is secure and I am back at a
more comfortable pace. I cross the line, having spent start to finish in the
second line.

## Results

Second, obviously. Not disappointed with the result despite the plans I made
halfway through the race. My [official time was 19:22][results], eight seconds
behind dark shirt. Philip finished third, another 22 seconds behind me. My
[Strava activity][strava] cannot be trusted as I did not press stop till after
Philip asked me what my time was. Whoops, second time in three races that I do
that. Blue shirt finished fourth in 20:14 and red shirt fifth in 21:07. The
girlfriend, finally, crossed the line as first female and sixth overall in a
21:38 she did not put much effort in.

Looking back at the race, maybe I should have tried pushing it harder sooner in
that second lap, but more gradually. Assuming I correctly found him on athlinks
though, he could have gone quite a bit faster still anyway. Even if I were
rested and ready to race, he likely would have still won, but hopefully less
easily. All in all, satisfied with this jog turned tempo turned race that I
only joined for the girlfriend.

Lessons learned:

* Checking out the course when you are racing is obvious, but also do it when
  you do not think you will end up racing.
* Sleep, sleep, sleep. Being well rested would have made a huge difference.
  Not only on race day, but also the part where I moved a run closer to it.
  Of course, had this been a goal race, I would have dropped or shortened that
  run rather than moving it around like that.
* It is worthwhile to know if you have a decent sprint or are more made for the
  longer speed up. I fear only more experience will be able to answer that one
  for me though.
